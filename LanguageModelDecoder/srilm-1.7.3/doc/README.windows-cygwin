SRILM version 1.3 and higher has been successfully built and tested using 
the CYGWIN environment (http://www.cygwin.com) as of Feb 11, 2002.
The test used CYGWIN DLL 1.3.9 and gcc 2.95.3 (but note the warning
in doc/README.x86 regarding a comiler bug), and ran successfully
on a Windows 98 and a Windows 2000 Professional system.

The following special measures were taken to ensure a successful build:

- Make sure the make, gcc, binutils, libiconv, gzip, tcltk, and gawk packages
  are installed with CYGWIN.  To run the tests you will also need the
  diffutils and time packages.

After installation, set your bash environment as follows

    export SRILM=/cygdrive/c/srilm13   # or similar
		# do NOT use backslash in path names SRILM=C:\... 
    export MACHINE_TYPE=cygwin
    export PATH=$PATH:$SRILM/bin:$SRILM/bin/cygwin	# mentioned in INSTALL
    export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$SRILM/man     		# mentioned in INSTALL

or the equivalent for other shells.

As of version 1.4.5, SRILM can also be built in the MinGW environment
(http://www.mingw.org).  For this the default (cygwin) has to be overridden
using

    make MACHINE_TYPE=win32

For 64bit binaries use 

    make MACHINE_TYPE=win64

Of course the corresponding versions of the MinGW development environment
(C, C++, binutils) have to be installed in Cygwin.  Make sure the Cygwin
installation is generally up-to-date.

It may be necessary to include the following directories in the PATH
environment variable for the runtime dynamic libraries to be found:

	/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin	(win32)
	/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin (win64)

Some functionality is not supported under MinGW:

    - compressed file I/O
    - nbest-optimize and lattice-tool -max-time option

Recommendations for compiling with Microsoft Visual C++
The build procedure has been tested with the freely available
Visual C++ 8 that can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com as 
"Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition".

0) Install the cygwin environment, as described in README.windows-cygwin .
   Cygwin tools are needed to run the build process and generate program
   dependencies.

1) SRILM can be set to the cygwin path of the SRILM root directory
   (e.g., /home/username/srilm)

2) Make sure environment variables are set to locate MSVC tools and files:

	PATH    should include MSVC_INSTALL_DIR/bin and 
	        MSVC_INSTALL_DIR/Common7/IDE (for dll search)
        MSVCDIR should be set to MSVC_INSTALL_DIR
	INCLUDE should be set to MSVC_INSTALL_DIR/include
	LIB     should be set to MSVC_INSTALL_DIR/lib

   Note: PATH needs to use cygwin pathname conventions, but MSVCDIR,
   INCLUDE and LIB must use Windows paths.  For example:

	PATH="/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 8/VC/bin:/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 8/Common7/IDE:$PATH"
	MSVCDIR="c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\\VC"
	INCLUDE="$MSVCDIR\\include"
	LIB="$MSVCDIR\\lib"
	export PATH MSVCDIR INCLUDE LIB

   could be used in bash given the default installation location of Visual
   C++ 2005 Express Edition under c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.

   Alternatively, you could use the vcvars32.bat script that comes with
   MSVC to set these environment variables.

3) Build in a cygwin shell with

	make MACHINE_TYPE=msvc

   or

	make MACHINE_TYPE=msvc64

   to generate 64bit binaries.

   As with MinGW, some functionality is not supported:

    - compressed file I/O other than gzip files
    - nbest-optimize and lattice-tool -max-time option

   Also note that make will try to determine if certain libraries
   are installed on your system and enable the /openmp option if so.
   This means that binaries built with the full Visual Studio compiler
   might not run on systems that have only Visual Studio Express.
   To avoid this disable /openmp by commenting out the corresponding
   line containing "/openmp" in common/Makefile.machine.msvc.

4) Run test suite with

	cd test
	make MACHINE_TYPE=msvc try

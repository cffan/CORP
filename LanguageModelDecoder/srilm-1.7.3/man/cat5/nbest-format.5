       nbest-format - File formats for N-best hypotheses lists

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       SRILM currently understands three different formats for lists of N-best
       hypotheses for rescoring or 1-best hypothesis  extraction.   The  first
       two  formats originated in the SRI Decipher(TM) recognition system, the
       third format is particular to SRILM.

       The first format consists of the header
            NBestList1.0
       followed by one or more lines of the form
            (_s_c_o_r_e) _w_1 _w_2 _w_3 ...
       where _s_c_o_r_e is a composite acoustic/language model score from the  rec-
       ognizer,  on  the  bytelog  scale.   (A  bytelog is a logarithm to base
       1.0001, divided by 1024 and rounded to an  integer.)   This  format  is
       output  by the SRI Decipher(TM) recognizer, by the nnggrraamm --nnbbeesstt, and by
       nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt --ddeecciipphheerr--nnbbeesstt.

       The second Decipher(TM) format is an extension of the first format that
       encodes  word-level  scores  and  time  alignments.   It is marked by a
       header of the form
            NBestList2.0
       The hypotheses are in the format
            (_s_c_o_r_e) _w_1 ( st: _s_t_1 et: _e_t_1 g: _g_1 a: _a_1 ) _w_2 ...
       where words are followed by start and end  times,  language  model  and
       acoustic  scores  (bytelog-scaled), respectively.  This format may also
       contain scores and time  marks  for  sub-word  units  (phones  and  HMM
       states),  in  the same format as above, but with the _w's denoting phone
       and state names.  Sub-word units will have time  marks  that  are  con-
       tained  in  the  duration  of the preceding word units, and may thus be
       easily identified.

       The third format understood by SRILM lists hypotheses in the format
            _a_s_c_o_r_e _l_s_c_o_r_e _n_w_o_r_d_s _w_1 _w_2 _w_3 ...
       where the first three columns contain the acoustic model log  probabil-
       ity, the language model log probability, and the number of words in the
       hypothesis string, respectively.  All scores are  logarithms  base  10.
       (This  format  must  not be preceded by an ``NBestList'' header.)  This
       format is output by the nnggrraamm --rreessccoorree  and  by  nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee  --wwrriittee--
       nnbbeesstt without the --ddeecciipphheerr--nnbbeesstt option.

       ngram(1),  nbest-lattice(1),  segment-nbest(1), nbest-scripts(1), pfsg-
       scripts(1).

BBUUGGSS
       All these formats are somewhat ad hoc and could  use  a  more  rational
       design.  The ``NBestList1.0'' format is particularly cumbersome because
       it conflates acoustic and language model scores.
       A generalization to an arbitrary number of  separate  scores  would  be
       nice.

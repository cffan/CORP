       Various  programs  dealing  with word classes use this format to define
       the posssible expansions of classes and their respective probabilities.
       Each  expansion  appears  on  a separate line as in the synopsis, where
       _c_l_a_s_s names a word class, _p gives the probability for the class  expan-
       sion,  and  _w_o_r_d_1  _w_o_r_d_2  _._._.   defines  the word string that the class
       expands to.  If _p is omitted it is assumed to  be  1.   (All  expansion
       probabilities for a given class should sum to one, although this is not
       necessarily enforced by the software and would lead  to  improper  mod-
       els.)

       Note  that  the  concept  of  word class here is generalized to include
       ``multi-words'', or phrases consisting of  more  than  one  word.   All
       expansions  must  have  at least one word.  Certain models might impose
       more restrictive formats.

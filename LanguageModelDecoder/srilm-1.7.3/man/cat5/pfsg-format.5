       Probabilistic finite-state grammars (PFSGs) are a form of  finite-state
       automaton or transducer used by the SRI Decipher(TM) recognizer.  PFSGs
       emit words (outputs) at the nodes, not on the arcs.  Certain  types  of
       language  models  manipulated by SRILM can be translated into PFSGs for
       direct use in the recognizer.

       Since it is usually fairly easy to convert  between  different  finite-
       state  network representations, PFSGs can serve as an intermediate for-
       mat for the generation of other  finite-state  formats.   For  example,
       PFSGs can be converted to the AT&T ffssmm(5) format.

       Each PFSGs is given a _n_a_m_e.  The name is significant if PFSGs are to be
       composed, in which case the _n_a_m_e specifies the category it expands.

       The nnooddeess line gives the number of nodes in the state  graph,  followed
       by  the word strings associated with each node.  If the node represents
       a category expanded by another PFSG, then the name string of that  PFSG
       is  given  here.   The  token NNUULLLL is special and designates the corre-
       sponding node as non-emitting.  It is  conventional  to  use  lowercase
       strings  for  words,  and  uppercase  for  categories  and  PFSG  names
       (``NULL'' must be avoided, of course).

       The iinniittiiaall and ffiinnaall lines specify the start and  end  states  of  the
       grammar, respectively.  Nodes are numbered starting at zero.

       The  ttrraannssiittiioonnss  line  gives  the number of arcs (transitions) between
       states.  It is followed by as many lines, each specifying  one  transi-
       tion  by its originating state _n_1, its target state _n_2, and the transi-
       tion cost _p.  The transition cost is  usually  interpreted  as  10000.5
       times  the natural logarithm of a probability, and should be normalized
       and scaled accordingly.

       File formats are a matter of taste ...
       There is no way to specify words with embedded whitespace.

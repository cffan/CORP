DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       nnbbeesstt--mmiixx  reads a number of N-best lists (which must contain identical
       hypotheses), computes the hypothesis posterior probabilities for  each,
       and computes a new posterior distribution that is a weighted mixture of
       the input distributions.  The hypothesis with the highest combined pos-
       terior probability is printed.

       The  command  line  arguments form an alternating list of weight values
       and N-best file names.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a compressed file (name
       ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Controls the amount of output (the higher the _l_e_v_e_l, the more).

       --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt _f_i_l_e
              Output N-best lists containing scores that correspond to the log
              of the combined posteriors of the  input  hypotheses.   The  log
              posterior is assigned as the acoustic score and other scores are
              set to zero.  This also suppresses the printing of the best hyp.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits the number of hypotheses read from each  N-best  list  to
              the first _n.

       --rreessccoorree--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets  the  language  model weight used in combining the language
              model log probabilities with acoustic  log  probabilities  (only
              relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).

       --rreessccoorree--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets  the  word  transition  weight used to weight the number of
              words relative to the acoustic log probabilities (only  relevant
              if separate scores are given in the N-best input).

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Divide the total weighted log score by _s_c_a_l_e when computing nor-
              malized posterior probabilities.  This controls  the  peakedness
              of  the  posterior  distribution.  The default value is whatever
              was chosen for _l_m_w, so that language model scores are scaled  to
              have weight 1, and acoustic scores have weight 1/_l_m_w.

       --sseett--llmm--ssccoorreess
              In  conjunction with --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt, output N-best lists that pre-
              serve the acoustic scores and word counts of the (first of  the)
              input  N-best lists, and encodes the combined log posteriors via
              the LM scores.  The LM scores in the output  are  calculated  so
              that,  when  combined  with  the  acoustic  scores and insertion
              penalties (using the given LM weight and posterior scaling), the
              result  is  the weighted, combined posteriors based on all input
              N-best scores.  This option is useful if input N-best lists were
              created  by  rescoring  with  different language models, and the
              output N-best lists are to be combined with other scores  or  if
              the score weighting is to be optimized with nnbbeesstt--ooppttiimmiizzee(1).

       --sseett--aamm--ssccoorreess
              Analogous to --sseett--llmm--ssccoorreess, except that the acoustic scores are
              modified to reflect combined log posterior  probabiltities,  and
              other  scores  are preserved.  This option is useful if input N-
              best lists were created by  rescoring  with  different  acoustic
              models.

 i was going to make some if you would tell me how to make them what do you what do you think
 you don't you don't know at all huh all right
 no
 beans right that's why i said beans
 maybe that's it you know they they they're researching
 uh they're researching how many foreign words a person uses when speaking to someone abroad
 uhhuh
 right
 okay
 okay
 okay uh so you received a letter in which i said uh send me the recipe for beans and rice
 yeah because uh yeah i would l- i would love to make it
 i i think that uh
 i think uh isabel um
 ye- yes yes
 is is uh is for isabel
 that's what you call that's the nickname for isabel
 uhhuh um
 i think she she like uh cooked some spices first
 uh like cumin and uh what are the english words for all of those
 uh jeez i don- uh parsley an- an- and then uh uh s- i think she boils the beans
 with with with she like fries the the spices in butter or or or like um
 heats them in butter and then puts the beans in
 and then i think the rice is added late- i i don't know i really don't know how it's done you're going
 yeah you're going to have to ask
 you're going to have to ask but you're going to get me all confused by throwing corn in i don't know anything about that
 oh yes yes
 now that's very interesting very interesting concept there
 i never heard them called that before
 gee it is confining to have to speak english isn't it
 yes yes
 yes oh it
 yes um see whenever i try to speak a foreign language
 the well i i say it in the letter the the the spanish is just so just totally unconscious and
 yeah and i'm rattling along in russian and then i come to the word but
 and and then i always say it in spanish and then it's followed by a rain of spanish
 and
 oh very very good
 uhhuh that's russian
 yes
 he'd been gone too long huh huh
 uhhuh
 but y- but but you know all
 although it is a russian word
 it it doesn't sound it's not a name word it's not
 i mean i never ever heard of a russian named that
 you know for example you know uh prince is a famous character in russian history
 um
 right right well like makes it an adjective
 so um so so that's that's very common and there was a very famous
 russian critic of russian literature named that too when i was in graduate school doing russian um
 but uh yeah you would not have a name like
 in in russian a last name like that it does you know i- it just
 it i don't know it's got to have s k y on it or
 one of the other russian suffixes and it doesn't have one
 well um
 they um
 huh i don't know uh you know there's this glut of um slavs
 ukrainians and russians all over the united states now
 oh i don't know i t-
 no you uh are we talking about
 i don't know
 hey i think we're supposed to be speech speaking english
 chili and beans and rice
 huh
 well they shouldn't talk to us then listen to us
 anyway when hermita makes she makes it uh often with corn
 uh using the english word not the chilean
 and uh i don't think she uses rice but uh
 uh i'm just i'm just waking up from my siesta so i'm a
 okay when i when i'm out of the sack i'll go ask her
 yeah yeah yeah yeah
 isabel is that what the
 oh okay
 okay
 th- that's a nickname yes oh
 you're making me hungry
 well mathey came home with some of those famous chilean meat turnovers today
 we had uh chilean meat turnovers for
 right
 anyway
 y- right
 i was amused by uh your
 your your report of your new neighbors who don't speak any english and you had to speak another foreign language to them and
 kept getting your wires crossed and speaking the wrong language
 h- having to think word for word
 too redundant
 uh speaking of of this other foreign language well russian i guess we can use an english word for that the uh uh w- we we
 are buying a car in fact we may even pick it up tomorrow
 and uh the uh the young man who is the salesman who is very nice his name is m i r
 and so i said to him and he looked at me say what
 so i said aw you don't you don't speak russian i said in spanish
 no he said he said no i i i know no russian uh uh i i have no association whatsoever with russian except i have this name he
 said it almost as if it
 well i would i i suspect that
 yeah yeah sure sure sure and then
 it's literally son of son of
 uhhuh uhhuh
 so
 sure what are your neighbors doing in living in
 she said that we're going to have topsy turny day and that's when like
 some maybe she said maybe the kids like get to act out as counselors
 counselors are kids
 and we like wear
 our um shirts backwards and our shorts backwards and stuff
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 two weeks oh my god
 that's a long time
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 in the ca- to the cape again
 oh
 what are you doing right now just sitting around watching everybody
 yeah
 uhhuh
 what's uh beauty doing
 eating all the books
 what is sivan doing
 i wouldn't leave the computer alone yesterday
 uh i've never even heard of that game
 know what
 at camp i have to keep kosher
 well that's what you'd probably have to do but um
 so my mother forgot all about it like it has to say kosher on it
 we do keep kosher but we know stuff is kosher without those little like
 k sign or
 o u
 so my mother forgot all about it and she bought all these snacks they didn't not one of them had
 o u or um
 k so we
 after we we got everything ready for camp
 and my mother started reading the newsletter and she goes
 rachel we have to check to make sure all your snacks are kosher we went upstairs not one of them
 was kosher
 so we had to go to the store and get all these new snacks
 i like the snacks before bed though
 and then
 the next day we went
 me my dad and emily and zia we went to um the butchery the kosher butchery
 and they had all these chips that were kosher i was like so happy
 in the berklan- berklaman
 yeah they have a lot of
 know what we saw there
 texas ribs and they were all bloody
 it was really disgusting
 oh they they have two one in framingham and one in brooklyn
 brookline
 they have a lot of kosher stuff in brookline a lot
 yeah i know
 yeah i know
 whatever
 yeah
 uhhuh
 oh
 yup are you excited about your bat mitzvah
 d- do you go to like lessons to
 what does that mean
 yeah i know
 oh
 does sivan do it
 oh
 you know what
 i'm getting tw- ten dollars for this call
 it's being recorded
 where did you find about it
 w- i w-
 oh she did
 hi beauty
 hi
 hi hi beauty
 yes
 uhhuh
 well okay sivan okay
 me
 dov sivan and my friend
 are staying up
 for two weeks
 but sivan's friend
 what
 but sivan's friend is only staying up for one week and he's going ba- he's staying for the first week
 and then we're
 me
 my brothers and aviva
 are going back
 to
 baltimore
 and sivan has a music camp
 for a week
 then we drive back up to
 massachusetts my whole family will drive up for around a week
 yeah
 well dov is watching t v
 my mom is in the book club
 i am sitting down on a chair in a very uncomfortable position
 there i'm better i have to switch the phones
 okay all better
 no
 i'm just walking around
 sivan i think he's downstairs on the computer
 uhhuh do you have
 wordperfect
 oh darn it
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah well um
 i went there before with
 it
 does do they also sell

 yeah
 uh
 yeah i'm almost sure that i've been there because i know it's in i think it's in framingham
 yeah i've been to a restaurant a kosher deli restaurant in brookline before
 took me there when i went up to
 right i know it's a jewish community
 we- i think on
 when we celebrate um
 the giving of the torah
 no not the giving of the torah
 when we finish reading the torah the end
 there's a big celebration
 my mom and your mom would uh like to go to brookline
 and watts like all the chassidic people
 like they had big celebrations everybody dancing chassidic people
 they wear big fuzzy hats sometimes
 they have long you know sideburns
 all curly
 yeah
 no i don't have to because
 um some people might
 some people who aren't orthodox they
 so that's when
 you go to bat mitzvah lessons
 well rachel my father is a rabbi so i don't really have to go to bat mitzvah lessons
 well is when you read the torah
 and so some people do that
 and some people just give a speech on the
 torah or the section that week but
 i know
 i know i'm going to also do this
 your mom told us
 oh guess what we gave beauty a bath today nish instead of calling her smelly we could call her scenty
 come here beauty want to say hi to rachel here's beauty
 rachel say hi
 uhhuh
 nothing i mean literally l- nothing i mean not even a little bit of relief you know i mean
 just
 uh i mean the the cough drops
 had like uh th- um three or four second anaesthetic
 uh effect and that was it you know the rest of the time you're sitting there sucking away and hurting and uh you know i just feel horrible
 oh it was awful and when i when i i stopped at your parents i stopped at a-
 we we drove through new hope on my way to washington
 and uh then went to dolington cemetery where i spent uh you know five or ten minutes with sitali
 and uh have you been there recently
 um
 have you been the- when was the last time you were there
 three years ago
 you know w- it was really odd because remember well you pro- i don't know if you remember when there was a little tiny tree
 next to
 next to mister david's uh uh stone tombstone
 and now there's this huge tree
 and the the huh the r-
 really
 yeah and i knew that that's what it where it was because chip said he pointed to the tree and he said this is where he is
 and then afterwards of course i've been back every time i i go into that area i always go
 and and so you know i i've seen the stone i've even taken pictures of it is that weird
 i think one time i was there and and i can't remember what it was i have pictures that i took at dawn so i don't know what i was doing there at dawn i was probably
 having insomnia and then i think i walked to the
 that's what i did w- that's what it was
 i walked to the to the graveyard and and uh when your parents were still living in the house
 and took pictures of and took pictures
 of the stone and now the tree is enormous
 and and the roots are
 pushing the stone out
 i mean you know like it's all crooked and you know
 and there was a christmas wreath
 next to the stone
 that was all you know brown and dry
 and and uh you know i said oh somebody brought a christmas wreath that's what i guess it was
 i did and i mentioned this but the- there was no
 or maybe i didn't mention it maybe i well maybe it was weird and i think i just w- said i'd been to the cemetery but i
 yeah
 and so we stayed there for a while and then and then we
 i took sitali on a driving tour through
 and then and then
 came to your parents' without
 um without warning without forewarning just so you know on an off chance that they would be there
 since they were on the way
 and they were really pleased to see it they had just gotten back basically from the shore not not long before
 yeah
 huh
 it must have been saturday i ca- i'm i'm having a hard time keeping track of da- days
 wait i can tell you that in a minute i've got my
 i left morristown on
 saturday that's right
 that was saturday
 uhhuh
 or was it sunday wait a minute hold it morristown
 washington no it was sunday
 it was sunday
 yeah the day yeah
 well like me yeah
 so we stayed there we had a sandwich we you know
 sat down for a while and and talked and
 and then we went on to washington
 and when i reached washington i was still feeling kind of awful but you know
 e- a-
 awful enough so so that it i was coughing this horrible disgusting not disgusting actually very painful
 totally dry
 you know
 wheezing kind of cough you know what i mean
 and it was very very very painful
 um
 and i was beginning to feel a little feverish and and
 the next day i helped my mother
 i took her to ikea and we took some furniture back and we
 built some furniture and we did all kinds of
 crazy things and then that evening we
 we had um we had went out and had a snack uh uh
 on a on a you know outside on the chairs outside
 and got rained on
 yeah it was ni- it was nice
 and that e- that night which w- i slept very poorly and during the night i was thinking i really shouldn't do this
 you know i shouldn't drive tomorrow it might even be dangerous
 because i was going to chip's and it was a pretty long drive washington to
 and um
 and then i at the same time i said but if i don't then
 i won't go you know i mean
 and that means that you know it'll be another five or six years before i
 i know
 yep
 uhhuh
 boy you got it really badly
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 no
 oh my god th- three years ago
 for david's f- uh thing
 oh my god
 oh been there at his stone i haven't been there ever i don't think i ever seen it say anything
 i always went and tried to find it before they put the stone up
 oh
 oh yeah
 oh you could send me that then i will have seen it
 right
 ha
 oh
 oh my god
 you're kidding
 really
 but you didn't see my parents after that to ask them if they did
 i would think
 yeah i don't think though th- that they would've done that but maybe they do that would be really sweet
 huh
 uhhuh
 oh yeah i guess that would be ri-
 because yeah you left
 yeah was it saturday or sunday
 right right right
 well you left friday morning
 yeah
 okay they'd just got back from the shore because they took uh we drove them to the airport
 and we le- uh they left probably there at noon and so they probably would've just gotten home
 at two something
 well either
 well
 day after they got him they don't remember days real clearly
 ooh uhhuh
 oh you're kidding
 yeah
 yeah yeah
 right
 phoenix two weeks
 because it's like
 no i don't know i don't i well you're not even going to be in philly so
 i think you sh- do you think your parents will let you move down there or no
 yeah
 i mean if you're paying rent for september first
 yeah
 you over at my place
 you can come over my place and borrow mine
 go to a garage sale that's what i did my mom me and my mom went to a garage sale today and she got me two beanbag chairs for two dollars
 two black beanbag chairs for two dollars
 yeah and i got a fan a big standing fan for five dollars
 like one of those big square ones
 and i went to a rummage sale and i got a dresser for
 e- three dollars
 is that what i said
 yeah no no no no no sorry sorry sorry sorry
 i got a dresser for five dollars i got a night stand for three dollars and i got a bookstand for
 twenty-five cents and i painted it black so it looks really cool now
 i told you i could bring that bed down if you want it do you need it
 i'll bring it down
 yeah i'll get the bed
 you have a couch you can make
 why not you need a couch
 put it in your room
 where did you get that from
 huh
 get crates like you know
 crates
 dude you don't want your stuff on the floor your clothes on the floor
 yeah
 you should like
 take down tools or something so you can build
 honestly go to like the wood store or hardware store or whatever and get some
 yeah i know but why can't you like now like go like to scrap places and get like wood and then like start building
 build a closet build a hanging something i don't know
 yeah but a lot of them don't they're really small closets
 they're like they're like they're like half closets you can't even fit a shirt in there
 you know
 huh yeah you do
 i don't know
 i don't know you shouldn't worry about it now you have less than a month but if you do go back aug- if you go back whatever august what is it the seventeenth
 that's what two weeks
 what if you do though i mean
 what if
 what if like
 i don't know your coach wants you there she can where would stay at the dorms
 yeah
 well see and then like
 well i have that bed you could have it
 it's a frame and a bed
 yup
 well why i mean eventually i'll have my own place anyway and my futon's going to be my couch
 and that'll probably be my bed
 it depends you know like where i go next year and stuff
 oh man
 yeah well
 i am too
 i'm interested
 i don't know when because my mom is like you know it's either he's going back or my dad's like well oh how is he going to get to school mom's like well he's going back august seventeenth or september twenty-third
 i was like ho- ho- look hold on i was like i'm not going back
 the first day of classes i was like i'm going back before that so they it didn't really get past that but i'm like i'm not going back that late
 i'm going to go back earlier than that because i can move in
 september fi- you know what i mean
 and i just kind of realized
 i know
 so i just k- and i also just kind of realized my mom wants really no part of me living in this uh
 in the house
 because i asked her i was like you know i'm going to need i was like you know ma i think i'm going to really need a lamp she's like yeah you are
 and i was like okay
 and i was like you know pots and pans she's like yep you're going to need all of that
 and she's like not even offering like you know i was like well do you have any extra and she goes no
 it's like okay
 it's like thanks for the help ma
 i'm kind of like i don't know what i'm going to do
 she's like pretty much
 wants no you know what i mean
 so yeah
 huh
 yeah i know
 i'm going to have like nothing
 it was like a lamp a lousy lamp i was like you know ma i think i'm going to really need like a floor stand lamp she's like yeah you're going to
 you should look into that i was like okay
 what
 no way
 screw you man
 i got
 my clothes are going to be like on the floor i figure
 i don't even have a bed
 i don't even know what i'm going to sleep on
 i d- seriously
 i'm think i'm like i might need it
 i'm going to be like as it looks i'm going to have to like lay a sheet down on the floor
 that's about all i have
 oh i have a
 two seater cou- see i have stuff that like i don't need
 that's like the only stuff i have is like stuff i really don't even need
 yeah i have a couch
 yeah i have
 i'm going to
 then i have like a chair like a nice like chair like you know what i mean it's got like
 wood side
 they just been sitting in our basement
 and my brother already took all the other furniture that was in our basement
 so when i have like a nights table like you know i have a s- i could have like uh a little table
 but i have like nothing to put my stereo on or in it's going to be sitting on the floor i guess
 too
 which i don't like but
 i don't know and i figure my clothes will be on
 figure my clothes will be on the floor right next to it
 then uh
 i know but i'm not going to have to hang them i don't know
 i'm going to have to leave a lot of clothes at home too i think i'm going to
 because i had too much at school
 i didn't wear any of them
 like they were just i just
 kind of there
 huh
 yeah see that all requires money though
 money money money
 because i don't know what i'm going to need it for
 see some of the rooms have closets
 some don't
 that's okay i don't need a big one
 that's alright though i don't need a big closet
 yeah just so people
 can't i don't know
 i don't know i guess i shouldn't worry about it now though
 you know
 yeah which i'm not
 yeah they have dorms for us
 for
 until school starts you can s- stay in the dorms
 you know
 i don't know
 i mean o- i'm not worried about like where to put my clothes because i can live out of a box for a while
 for a long time i guess i could live out of boxes
 sh- i need a bed
 that's all i need
 and i don't know about that yet i mean
 i don't know
 i have to ask my
 i really have no clue
 is it just a frame
 there's a mattress
 wow see i don't want you to like have to
 your what
 what do you mean
 five day nook and cranny and uh make use of it i mean just
 a- another random example of this there are apparently
 um
 various beetles that are found in caves in michigan
 and these things
 basically people believe had to have been adapted from normal
 um you know ground walking
 beetles but these are now adapted to life in caves
 and given that michigan is covered by glaciers ten thousand years ago
 that's the evolutionary time scale in which there has been this
 development of the sightless beetle and of course at the bacteria level
 the adaptations are that much faster
 so yeah i mean uh people
 i think have justifiably given up the idea of having
 um
 anything uh basically well anything macroscopic elsewhere in the solar system
 but as far as microorganisms uh
 boy you know it sure seems like there's a lot of possibilities 552 45 558 95 b well another big possibility seemed to be uh titan uh the big moon of saturn there which uh
 y- yes except that if it actually has nothing going on right now
 the sun's expansion is not going to
 have uh be a very long
 ter- time expansion as these things go
 it'll only be
 um a few million years
 so unless
 e- evolution precedes
 yeah right i mean g- you know look at how long it took earth to produce something that's living now
 a billion years now first the earth was cooling down but the other thing is
 u- we don't know enough about
 these various moons especially the large ones like titan or europa or whatever
 i think to really exclude the possibility that
 even though it is extremely cold
 on the surface
 that you might not have some sort of
 uh b-
 life form in a liquid which is deeper in the interior maybe that would be warmer
 i guess the main thing about the heat is that
 the chemical processes that drive
 any life form
 uh take place
 much more efficiently at higher temperatures
 and
 if uh you know my my understanding is that
 for um more complicated life forms like us for example
 you know the the
 main reason we have enzymes is so that we can overcome these barriers and so we don't actually have to have body temperatures of five hundred celsius
 but
 for microorganisms it may be uh
 more difficult because you don't
 i think generally have you know the initial form of life having lots of complicated enzymes
 ex-
 yeah that's exactly what it is
 right
 yeah i do
 right
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 well another big possibility seemed to be uh titan uh the big moon of saturn there which uh
 with its hydrocarbon snows and methane lakes uh
 would be although probably totally dormant at this point
 uh an ideal uh
 prospect uh when the sun expands
 yeah
 unle- unless there's some active organic molecule uh doing its job uh or more than an organic molecule but something you're saying that is actually
 a productive life form of some form some type no
 about a billion years i think
 uhhuh
 the enzymatic input that you referenced there uh is essentially um
 uh what catalytic uh overcoming
 yeah overcoming the uh
 otherwise uh
 disadvantageous conditions
 uh hey great news now you know at at some point in your life when
 the great professorial track uh opens up to you uh and you're going to
 live in something other than
 uh the ruskolnikoff type of uh
 environment uh
 uh you know what i'm referring to don't you
 yeah he uh he tended to live very much as you do
 at the present time
 with perhaps uh
 uh more of a dank environment though than you but at any rate uh
 uh once you uh step
 uh you know accede to the next level of uh affluence or whatever
 uh
 you will probably be able to subscribe to a cable television hook up and
 get yourself a t v that gives you some feedback besides uh
 a foggy dream state or something
 uh but at any rate uh
 uh the
 trouble
 following wonders of the universe which is as you know a half an hour show i told you
 had been
 an abomination it was something called uh
 oh uh mysteries of the great beyond or some
 crock of manure which uh proved to be after one examination by me uh
 utterly useless groundless and paranormal based uh
 but uh this time around
 they had a show called and uh i uh
 the indication was this was going to be a regular connection
 practical guide to the universe uh a ninet- a nineteen ninety three production
 tom selleck is the host
 and i'm going to tell you something
 this was absolutely outstanding in fact in my opinion
 it was superior to wonders of the universe because
 there was actually substantive
 discussion they risked actually having talking heads uh you know the no no of
 of uh of any uh
 cognitive level below fourth grade right
 uh and it was i was saying they talked about the koby satellite uh briefly
 and
 and speaking of the koby satellite by the way
 um do you buy uh although this was not mentioned in the film
 and you have to watch the dog so now that's what we've been doing
 so we're like you get the car
 now
 for the time being
 it was so funny
 so he's like well yeah but you're talking such a nice car and
 you know so
 yeah i was like
 oh and he was so negative about this car
 well you know and then i feel bad like oh my god did i make a bad purchase choice here
 he makes me feel bad for h- for wanting a nice car oh my god i
 i know
 i know i go bobby
 what excuse me but do you know how much we paid for this car
 and i kept going on and on and on about
 yeah but
 yeah
 well i i don't know he's like well did you did you really need something with all that he goes yeah he goes
 you know and he's talking musician you know he's talking
 well yeah sure it's hip and it's got the you know and it's like
 t- todd what's wrong with it and i was like
 wait a minute you still don't have a car do you
 that's right why do you need he's probably just pissed because i've had two cars now and he's had none
 so that's what it is he's mad
 i don't know eh- it's there's some kind
 there's some kind of strange thing going on
 now now it looks like there i- there's something wrong with the ownership itself
 because
 yeah because there was a illegitimate son apparently in mississippi somewhere who now wants to claim part of the uh
 i mean as far as i know this guy didn't have much
 when he died i mean it's not like they have to like claim elvis presley's estate or anything
 you know i mean we're talking an itty bitty house not worth five thousand dollars
 you know and now they have
 there's a a problem with with
 who really is the the rightful owner
 you know it's just i don't know it's just all whacked out so bobby just the sign's at least down
 the sold sign
 yeah i was tired of looking at that for about a year you know
 so but it's still in the hands i guess of this lawyer and he's just i don't know i so they're just kind of sandbagging just keep paying the rent keep paying the rent
 you know nobody knows
 meanwhile the whole porch is falling off
 yeah
 it's not even worth fixing it it really isn't
 i i know i- just because he doesn't want to move his crap he probably just doesn't want to clean his room
 it's easier
 i'll just buy the house damn it i don't have to
 that way i don't have to clean up
 you know i i often wonder i'm going
 alright
 let me think about this
 where did bobby come from exactly
 i'm sure
 you know people do think that
 yeah but it's not really a job see that's the thing
 see he couldn't really do real work
 i keep i think he's proven that
 yeah
 well i don't know when you say
 he's uh
 he's going out to play it's not like we go to work he's going out to play
 that's right he goes to play
 we go to work
 that's right
 yeah
 oh i'm sorry
 that's right well i've been listening to my grandmother too much
 granny's so excited i go
 she she says she's ready to go
 she's ready she's waiting on the porch waiting for us to come get her
 i go
 yes that's right if it's not a
 well
 and then
 that's right that's the thing and then she goes now there's five people crammed in the car
 now she's like oh well if it's going to be too much bother so now this is her thing because there's five people
 she's not a pack a thing a suitcase she's just packing two carry bags
 that's all she's bringing
 she goes well that's all i need i don't need anything
 and so then like i saw her like last week some like when we decided i went to over the house or something right
 okay well if i don't hear from you i'll see it on that sunday
 like i live like i live i live like four miles away from her house well if i don't hear from you i'll see you on sunday
 don't don't worry about that
 oh god
 aw
 aw
 uhhuh
 see
 you just you just overspent that's all there's to it
 i spend too little money for too much car there's something wrong with this picture
 i don't deserve it
 but maybe you don't deserve it
 what do you think huh
 see there you go
 that's probably why he's asking you why do you need a car
 that's right what are you going to do
 did he ever buy that house
 oh
 oh they can't get clear title
 oh shit
 yeah
 sheeze
 oh my
 oh it is huh
 jeesh
 yeah
 oh that that house needs a lot of work
 no
 i don't know why he's even buying it
 that's right n-
 i don't have to pull the stuff under my bed i'm fine
 he was adopted we never told anybody
 bobby was adopted
 i mean where do you know a jones that holds a job for that long
 think about it
 no way he's adopted we have we have to
 oh your father said what job so long
 but she she came to the conclusion it's not a job
 it's something he does we don't know exactly what
 well he li- lives off royalties and family
 that's right he goes to play
 and we go to work
 yes
 no no that's that's old farts talking going to play now he's going to do a gig get with it
 you know
 yeah i know
 oh yeah i bet you she probably packed
 she she told your father about twenty times
 well if i'm not in any way i could come down with them
 th- this was before the car was bought well you know
 when they come down i don't know when
 but i could come down
 if it's no bother to you
 no
 and your father say no it's okay ma come down
 well i don't want to be in the way
 oh jeez
 yeah
 oh jeez
 yeah
 oh jeez
 just don't forget swing by here on your way down
 see who else will somebody else important uh all the dean is the whole school are out for a week
 yeah
 um let's see well i guess i could come up actually anytime
 now
 i have to work tonight
 at the uh computer lab
 and i have to cook too
 today's my today's my work day for the week
 yup
 tomorrow
 let's see well i don't see any reason why not
 unless i get a hot date
 boy it's been a really good month
 oh for women
 having fun
 yeah i did
 i talked to one guy
 and he said uh well he goes i
 got this thing in the mail for this other company and he had showed me this ad that he had clipped
 and there was another one that he was offering something very similar to l c i and it was
 just as a customer
 that was advertised in the paper
 but actually i can burn i could actually
 this really is about the first time that i've been
 like this is kind of like the first lull in my battle
 actually
 and i think i might win
 because um it's ridiculous
 it really is ridiculous because i was like last week i was just really depressed
 and just because of the whole situation
 no well like i can do it back
 uhhuh
 right
 right
 okay
 and angela is going to be back today anyway
 back for the summer
 so
 well that's okay
 yup
 yup
 wow
 wow
 all right
 yup
 i-
 really what was your last check
 all right
 well shoot
 well the seats are
 uhhuh
 seeds are all in the ground
 really
 wow
 terrific
 well there doing your doing just fine
 really
 right
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 right
 that's right
 all right
 yup as they say it's ninety percent perspiration
 uhhuh
 that's right
 really
 oh really
 okay well when are you going to come up then
 okay well how about now
 yeah
 have to work where
 oh okay
 oh oh
 oh okay so your work day is on tuesday right
 okay well then why don't you come tomorrow
 uhhuh
 oh brother
 what do you mean for what
 oh
 did you sign up any of these people did you talk to them about your business did you have you talked to anybody about your business at all
 who'd you talk to
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 was it excellen- he even has a um were you talking to him as a field trainer or was that a just a f- customer
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah well that's good
 that's good
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah well you can't let in something like that get you down you know
 just just think you'd this is what you've really you need to come back up here
 because angela needs to be contacted she needs to get her all away
 this jason guy needs to be contacted
 you need to talk to um bob about getting him signed over
 i mean this is
 oh okay
 okay well that's good than we can go ahead and get working on her
 who knows she talk about her mother wants to take a marketing class or something
 before she signs everyone think isn't she crazy she doesn't need it
 you know so we got to get them back there you know and talk to them
 so well yeah things are going we have almost two hundred customers and
 bobby will make e f t with the next three customers he gets
 which means that every ti- every person that he signs up as a filtrator he'll be getting a hundred and fifty dollars instead of ninety
 and for every person he signs up as a o c he'll be getting sixty instead of forty
 so he said mom's almost there also
 so she's got one more field trainer
 that's to qualify and then she'll be e f t also
 well they are they are do- the money's coming in the money's
 it's starting to come in jeff i tell you
 yeah um it was eighty eight
 we haven't g- we haven't gotten any l d u texts yet
 because i asked you to it's just not it's just not cook kicking in
 well you can see what people are using a hundred and twenty three and forty five and all of that stuff and fifteen
 this is going to be nice
 yes they are yes they are mom signed up the um mayor's brother in pittsburgh
 and he s- and he signed up his wife
 and they're going to sign up their two daughters and they're f- they said that they see the opportunity they're going to be going to columbus with us when they they have the regional thing
 they see the opportunity they see it
 so we are we are just really tickled to death
 so things are things are going but not going as fast as i would like them to go
 yeah i'd like to go live with my goal was to get one o- one out of the way every day
 right and that works well because uh one out of the way is very attainable it's not hard to do
 so that's what i've been doing and that's what bobby has been doing and but we're going to have fifty customers before you know it we've got
 about twenty five personal customers
 but you know the people that sign up under us
 they've been signing themselves up otherwise we'd be there by now
 but you know our goal is to get fifty customers so that we can quit
 worried about we can stop worrying about getting customers and just training our people
 and pat and carol signed up as field trainers
 and so everything is everything is really starting to take off
 so we're very happy with that
 yeah it is the thing of it is you take the time you take a c- few months to take the time to sew the seeds
 and then hey everything happens everything just happens
 kitty is now making five hundred dollars a week
 a boundary of a circle being a straight line how is the boundary of a circle a straight line
 yeah i guess
 uhhuh
 so
 well actually i mean with the definition of a geodisec it gives us really something like
 the fact that um it's a line um
 which
 which is is locally straight which um
 is the shorter well i mean it its either the shortest distance between two points
 um or
 um somehow it is going around the other way
 so like if you yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah i guess so
 so i i so i guess like so what is your your criterion for for having
 straight lines on a sphere like
 huh how do you know if if a straight if a line is straight on a sphere
 okay
 uhhuh yeah i guess i'm i'm still not really sure um so
 uhhuh
 okay
 sure
 uhhuh
 okay
 but
 uhhuh okay but but suppose you were you had a video camera and you were on the surface of the of the sphere
 and you lived there right
 uhhuh but that's only because its over a short distance i mean sometimes lines
 le- wait do you see lines as curving
 right so
 so i mean what kinds what's what is the simplest sort of line that you could draw that that would that would seem to curve
 okay so you have your sphere and you and you have like like there are some lines like spirals and
 um and things like that that obviously wouldn't be straight right
 but are there any other are there any sort of of
 simpler lines which aren't straight
 to provide a counter example
 any any other lines which aren't geodesics
 okay so so suppose um you you really could divide a line into
 into the smallest parts and say that that they were basically indistinguishable from from points
 okay
 so we know that between any two any two points there's a straight line right
 but suppose you add a third point
 right
 so then between
 between the second
 and the third point
 there's a straight line right
 but how can you tell if that's the same straight line as between the first
 it's it's a similar
 i don't think it is actually but
 i- its that its that kind of a curve as what i mean just that
 it's following
 it's if your tra- if your going to trace around the circle
 it its foll- you know you'd be following the curve of the circle does that make sense
 well if you make it that in the three dimension
 if your trying to draw a line you know you're following the curve on
 the sphere you can't just draw
 like a straight line as in a str- uh
 like perpendicular to a plane
 yeah yeah that that that's wh- that's yeah how i would picture the straight line it would be the shortest distance between
 two points on a but from let's say the equator to the pole it is y- if your picturing that on a sphere
 connecting the two it still curves in a way
 does that make sense
 okay just just want to make sure you'd know what i mean
 but that's the only place i have confusion on straight lines in a sphere
 well that's what i'm say- i'm not i'm not sure if you can have a straight line on a drawn on a sphere
 that's why that's what i was ask- asking what you meant by a straight line on a sphere
 like okay pic- let's say pic- picture your sphere just let me see if i can clarify what i'm having trouble with
 now you can draw a line straight through the sphere from the nor- say the north pole to the south pole
 and that we would say the straight line
 no questions asked right
 okay but along the surface of this sphere from let's say one pole to the other
 um if your tracing that that's not the same
 line that you got when you went right through it
 it's going out and then back in from that point
 and that that that's what i mean by um like you know curving following the sphere
 yeah then then it would look like
 straight lines like when you have lines drawn on a road dividing the sides of a highway
 we see them as straight or the road itself we see as straight and not curving
 yeah
 the what do you mean
 yeah
 any other sort of lines that aren't straight
 um other than
 um
 i don't know
 i i'm still unclear on exactly what the defin- how a geodesic is being described
 okay
 yeah
 okay
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 praise the lord
 good for you good for you well see dana put his foot down
 he said that baby is not going be in the bed no more
 lazy i'd lay it right in the bed so then i ended up a in hope
 bed with her
 yeah
 and then i'd get her to sleep and then i'd go back in there with him it was crazy i shouldn't have done it you're doing the right thing
 oh it's not it wasn't for me all the time there were times i'd get up and i would almost think
 oh hear that baby
 scream and you and you want to sleep that is natural i felt the same way
 oh i hear your mom praising you
 you don't that's a oh
 that's the biggest thing and that's the thing i dread with this kid is knowing i won't sleep
 oh sometimes mostly it comes from laziness
 so i think amanda's more like me too just being lazy you are stubborn and determined enough you're going to do the right thing
 i was half asleep and i didn't care
 your right
 you've heard me on the phone going
 i'm going get the paddle if you don't
 oh well
 yeah yeah
 i seen some of it when
 uhhuh
 oh
 uhhuh
 oh now amanda does have a different kind of personality i'm more like you i'm like who did this who is responsible for this
 i g- i yeah well you heard me when drake had grape juice get off of my carpet
 with that grape juice
 so yeah
 oh
 oh
 oh it does i've learned i have learned patience through prayer a lot
 because i would get i would fly off the handle and if i didn't keep self control
 and let god just keep self control in me i mean i would get to where i was screaming at the top of my lungs and i was so mad
 i could have thrown him through the window and i thought
 linda you've got to stop this its only you know grape juice
 it's only uh uh
 it would oh it would just oh it was awful so and i have learned
 and then having ashley too i have learned
 i'd get mad at her over toast in the morning she wouldn't eat the toast
 unless it was all brown and i would throw a religious fit and i would make her eat it
 it would take thirty minutes and i would make her eat that toast
 and finally one morning and i know it was probably god because it was like a voice in my head just said
 it's only toast
 and i thought how true it's only toast throw it away make a new one
 problem is done and i have learned i have learned that
 yeah i guess lena is more particular
 i'm not as neat i i'm not
 i told you i had to
 yeah
 yeah she is she is
 that's true i guess i do maybe have more patience than i think i do
 i w- i work on it oh
 oh i know it and you know why amy she had to have those babies
 uh um yes
 she did because i was seven months pregnant with hope when we were at our reunion
 and she had two since then
 okay
 she was using the sponge
 yeah she was using that sponge thing gary don't like
 c- condoms here we are talking about something
 yay
 but uh and so she tried that but i guess they weren't real effective uh
 who knows
 oh and she cried and she of course no she didn't mean to do it she was trying
 not
 that you don't ovulate and sometimes you don't
 but sometimes you do but i like
 my sissy can bless his heart but you know
 uh that's why i would never like bring her in bed with me because no she's not going to invade my bedroom too
 that's just how i feel about it i want my time with my husband
 did he
 oh no so you just forsook your whole bed oh my goodness
 i don't know i worry i f- i feel like you have more of a loving nature and i just thought it would be there naturally but it's not for me
 yeah yeah well mom said she did the same thing and dad told me too he said that mom would say i'm not getting no sleep
 but i feel like you and amanda are totally different though that i mean it just seems to me like you you just
 oh real loving and just real natural about it
 well ted said you need to go live with them too and find out if it's like that everyday
 they know it it doesn't seem to bother you
 perfect example amanda has um her living room she has a formal living room
 and it's you know just cute as can be all done in victorian just it's just spotless and
 and she keeps it that way
 well one of the kids got in there and banged her chair into the wall and tore a big
 strip on the wallpaper
 and i told my mom that i would have found out which kid did that if it took me years
 and i would have beat them within a into the lights and then i would have had to replace the wallpaper
 but it's not bothering amanda could care less
 always
 oh i would have beat his butt though if he'd a spilled it and he did he spilled it and you just do not quite you know
 did it really bothered you that then
 really
 and its probably a lot of things combined throughout the day that makes
 do you want to just do that
 oh
 aw
 it's only toast
 well your
 mom says that lena is more that way than you are she says that you're more laid back then lena
 yeah they
 well she says you don't get uptight
 she says lena is kind of nervous about it
 w- well i think you do i would have never guessed it but i think you do i mean would have just never
 of course three children and that blows my mind
 like lena back to back
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh
 yeah oh yeah well she got pregnant breast feeding
 now did lena
 they did they think because she was breast feeding that they didn't need to use anything
 oh my goodness
 oh this would be great the the survey people
 obviously not real effective
 oh well because the thing now the reason i ask is because some people think
 when you're breastfeeding that right
 you can't tell
 washington d c and maryland or baltimore and it's close to everyone
 yeah it was a good flight
 when we were on a seven fifty seven
 it's pretty big yeah i figured it would be bigger actually for a seven fifty seven
 it was good we got some peanuts and bars and pretzels and coke
 yeah
 ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
 no
 it was fun
 and i could leave here early so
 it worked out well hopefully he'll fly back for
 is this all the time
 so
 uh we're getting ready to practice poker
 huh
 yeah yeah oh sorry
 yeah yeah
 anna
 oh good
 uhhuh
 is she going over right away or
 yeah
 huh
 oh
 oh really
 i don't know
 not necessarily
 anyway
 yeah
 yeah i know isn't it
 it's free or actually they only have to pay ten dollars to do it
 he gets paid ten dollars to do it
 only a couple
 but
 do you get ten bucks with them
 do you get ten bucks for this
 how many times have you called
 oh
 oh really
 you might be able to do it too
 yeah
 for the use of
 and it's recorded
 they use that for educational purpose
 um
 i don't know
 do you
 that's good i miss you too
 yeah
 of course i do

 and um
 she
 what was i going to say she um
 it wasn't long distance actually it where she lives it wasn't long distance that's c-
 yeah
 huh
 i mean if you don't have to dial a one it's not long distance right
 huh
 right
 i forgot this call is being recorded
 it's kind of weird
 yeah
 what
 every call
 who he gets paid ten dollars
 oh
 how do you find out about it
 alright
 i miss you
 yeah
 oh you do
 oh
 what'd you say
 oh
 i'm going to get upset again i think
 i know
 huh
 no

 i see
 well there's at least two that you just told me about
 two new light
 and that's it so how many are you down to
 ten eleven so
 one
 i see so you have a total of about thirty-five
 but that's uh that fills up the pretty good no
 yeah good so you're very there
 good hu- hopefully hopefully uh
 yeah
 you have rough plans of coming back next elo
 next
 coming up
 i hear
 oh that's
 at this point
 i hear
 okay
 okay
 so must have
 not everybody has to speak to everybody no
 basically emma had the last call
 and so i get this call
 but emma is on the phone so emma does hear everything
 well we can't talk two people at one time
 excuse me
 what's that
 you can't break the rules right no we haven't
 do it
 we're very very appreciative of this opportunity
 sure
 oh uh please right me the whole again please or or the new uh the old i have
 but so you just now gave her again
 four hundred dollars because she just wrote to me that she got two hundred dollars i think from you
 and then you must
 okay where's all this coming from if you can tell me if not you can write me
 oh from the six hundred i sent
 oh so dvora took four
 and
 and yehuda took two
 okay
 fine
 fine very good
 yeah
 yeah
 whatever she can use whatever credit card she want
 oh w- one second that she should let me know
 she should let me know the number though
 there because there's one that has an annual fee i would e- would prefer if you didn't use that one
 all right if it does and if it's convenient she can uh let her use whatever she wants
 okay
 yeah and i'll get the charges listen if you would also do me a favor maybe
 and send me
 a copy of your telephone bills as you get them
 because i g- i lately got a bill for about eighty dollars
 uh uh do you spend that much
 eight oh
 yeah
 so i don't know who it is because
 yeah so i- i-
 yeah so so s- so save your statements and send them to me becau-
 yeah send me a xerox of them or whatever okay if you don't mind because otherwise i have no way of checking
 and they do make mistakes because i know there was one charge they charged twice
 okay how's sifi doing
 good good yeah how's the job working out
 uhhuh uhhuh
 uh uhhuh
 uhhuh how many nights
 three uhhuh so that's all out of the house
 i see and and how does sari adjust to the new schedule
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 how that could be
 that could be
 all right
 uhhuh
 in stages comes and goes
 so maybe that's it
 maybe i-
 yeah
 oh yeah
 she's up on all fours precocious
 precocious child uh she getting into mischief
 not yet
 uhhuh
 i see i see i see
 okay very good
 no do you know where it might be
 the kitchen cabinets in the basement what right when you come down the stairs
 yeah where dvora's gifts are
 the bottom shelf of the top cabinet
 yeah
 right
 yeah and and and how is the wrapped
 i
 mommy's going to go and take a look right now
 i looked s- uh several times but all right well we'll get it to you that's not a
 a whole bunch left last month
 what
 that's it there's only two two
 uh maybe ten eleven
 not more than ten i don't
 not more than ten i don't think
 yeah something like that
 oh yeah yeah yeah
 yeah
 a- as it stands
 we have um rough plans of going back
 not

 now
 right
 yeah it's possible there's no plans yet you know what i'm saying that's
 yeah
 that's
 okey-do-
 oh wait so if everybody has to speak to everybody that's eight different people
 oh
 oh yeah
 uhhuh can't break the rules
 can't break the rules
 you can't break the rules
 uhhuh
 did you did can i ask you a question please
 a a few things first of all four hundred dollars dvora has
 ou- out of the six hundred that you sent them
 okay
 okay and uh that's it
 yeah
 no the six hundred y- you just sent
 right
 and yehuda took two because he didn't have change
 that's one thing and uh second of all dvora wants to know
 if it would be a problem take her american credit card
 huh whatever uh whose credit card no i think dvora's
 dvora has your credit card uh or you have dvora's credit card
 okay
 what
 yeah okay
 yeah yeah okay uh fine
 uh okay
 yeah
 yeah
 no
 how much
 eighty
 it's not us
 wait let me check
 so the statements we get no no way eighty
 i have them all i can send them to you
 no way eighty
 very very good
 we've we've yeah we we both went back full schedule
 and now in the night first of all in yeshiva they pay
 and i also tutor three nights a week
 and i'm three
 yeah
 uh i don't know this week she was well very freaky
 she woke up like five times a night it gets to be i don't know
 oh yeah she's a good kid
 but the nights now bananas
 i don't know and she doesn't go to sleep anymore by herself
 yeah she's teething like like t- like mad
 no i mean we could tell what it is we have we have stuff for her teeth
 that's not what it is
 why doesn't she go she goes she goes i don't know i just don't like it in there
 and uh she's up on all fours
 yeah she's up and around
 uhhuh
 not yet
 it takes her still a a while to get across the living room she got trapped under the couch once or twice
 but she's not into the kitchen cabinets yet
 did you by any chance find my
 it's in the botto- i- in the in the kitchen cabinets in the basement
 yeah
 the bottom shelf of the top cabinet
 i'm al-
 i'm almost sure it's there we have a few like tablecloths
 and a few boxes of uh you know stuff that's marked everything's marked ours
 we have a few boxes that are clearly marked
 in a clear pla- like a shirt
 okay it should be right there
 did- e- it could be mixed in between table cloths or challah covers we have down there
 and then they had a pretty um cherry wood shelf and i ordered that all that grouping i'm putting in the dining room i think
 uh probably in a couple of weeks so
 anyway i had um this uh remember that copper pot eucalyptus pot um
 well that pot i had well i decided i couldn't find any place it really went anymore
 so i sold this i sold it to this girl at work and then she wanted a eucalyptus arrangement in it
 so i did this huge euc- eucalyptus arrangement and i filled it out for the cost of what it would cost to bottle that stuff for the wall so i
 i came out okay on it yeah yeah
 and then i did a eucalyptus heart for her but i have done eucalyptus for three days now and i can tell that
 and i kind of told people once i was done with what eucalyp-
 that i that i used up and that would be it
 big time i felt so terrible when i got up today you know that i think i i'll have to quit it after this so
 the thirteenth i go in so
 and i sent my little eight page questionnaire in
 they have to make the chart up and evidently they must have to have all that information there for the doctor ahead of time
 so anyway i got it all done josh is here for the day
 yeah the
 well yeah she called last night and said that they had been um oh he didn't have a temperature but on his hearing test
 really didn't do as well and they called the doctor and they thought he had he had fluid in his ears so they gave him an antibiotic and
 and he's on that but you know he didn't have temp so they've had the time of their life today
 they've played they have been fighting you know just
 guns and what have you around the house and just have had the time of their life
 yeah so i they went to see um
 and they rode down on the old folks bus we figured on sleeping all the way and i said
 well what if they have a party
 you know you- you're not going to get any sleep
 well sure they do i know where they're going to tonight they're going to be asleep but whatever and then they won't get in until a quarter until twelve
 tonight and then they'll
 yeah they'll stay over and then he said he needed to go home and make sure
 his dog was okay that suzy was okay so they wouldn't stay late tomorrow but we're going to go to omaha tomorrow
 because i want to go to ou- ours is opening at thanksgiving time now it's in january i guess
 yeah it's made me happy
 so anyway
 no and you know what i've never seen so many children so confused about when
 g- she's leaving when she's coming
 well no she went last sunday they left
 yeah but nobody knows who she they left when they left to come back or if they wait until like wednesday to come back
 well i don't know and loretta i thought maybe it was this wednesday but loretta thought maybe it was next wednesday and
 i've been wrong all the way through so why would i be right about this
 do you think it's this wednesday
 i thought all the way until next wednesday would be a long time so
 yeah yeah and that'll be a nice visit
 i didn't know susan was expecting
 no i knew barbie was but not susan
 well that's age
 i i haven't heard anybody over thirty-five talk about an easy one
 and i doubt i will
 it's hard we have um have had big changes here in the um the medical offices
 because methodist bought out part of norfet medical group
 e- yes and um emmanuel one of the big surprises two of the physicians and two of the p a's
 resigned and didn't go with methodist they went with emmanuel and it they thought they all would go with this methodist and boy did that cause
 a rucka
 i mean uh unbelievable
 so so i think it would be good for the community because i think they'll bring in a lot more physicians
 yeah and i think that would be good so
 well i we need more family practitioners
 there's not that many left
 you know i mean you could always use more specialists more o b g y n that's always good competition don't you think
 i think nowadays you just have to have people with deeper pockets
 oh no w- you know i did not realize they say inpatients um
 huh
 so when are you going to get that
 huh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh yeah
 well good job
 i was wondering if that wouldn't bother your allergies
 so when do you get your allergy testing
 oh
 oh they review it before you go in huh
 huh
 oh he is
 she decided to leave him huh
 whoa
 well that's neat so when now where was it that you went
 oh
 yeah really they might
 some of those people live for that
 tonight
 are they going to stay over then
 oh
 well that's good
 yeah really
 so has anybody heard from mom
 huh
 well did she leave on sunday
 yeah and she they were supposed to get there like wednesday i think or something wasn't it
 oh oh you don't know i was just going to ask you
 i think it's this week
 uhhuh
 yeah plus they're stopping at rosalie's on the way back too so
 yeah
 oh you didn't
 yeah i think she's had kind of a rough time
 yup it is
 yeah probably not
 how come
 oh really
 jeez
 huh
 yeah they probably will
 more specialists
 oh really
 huh
 yeah i think it is
 well so are the hospitals pretty stable or do you think
 well what are we going to do wednesday
 do you want to go or you want to stay home
 okay
 oh that's when you left
 oh gee
 yeah it don't matter
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
 uh it's just another day take my word for it
 yeah i said something to damon about getting one of them thermal uh amigo big huge cup mug things whatever
 they had some really bright colors somebody at work had one and i thought it was kind of cool
 he says whoa jeez it costs two dollars and forty-nine cents that's a little too much muh muh muh and i said well you could give it to me for my birthday
 and today he comes home they don't have them cups anymore mom
 yeah oh well it was just a suggestion
 he fixed a lawn mower for his dad for his birthday so
 of course dad bought all the parts but
 damon put it together and that's what he gave him for a birthday present is the old lawnmower
 now that doug has sat down um if anything should happen to me between now and christmas
 doug's christmas present will be at ace hardware
 in that back room under my name and they're only supposed to talk to me so you know
 just just in case
 i need a backup because the sucker's been paid for
 and it's some it's something you guys will be able to use too so it would be to your benefit to remember to pick it up
 yeah
 so
 now i got that off my chest
 oh
 i go- i got to thinking after i got that i thought well i'm the only one that knows about this
 and if anything happens
 it'd just go back on the shelf what a pity it cost a lot of money
 i thought pat and nila can use it i'll tell nila
 yeah i know but i mean to make sure he got it because it's paid for
 because i don't know what would happen to it otherwise i suppose you know if it's not claimed it would
 go back on the shelf
 huh
 oh i suppose
 lay down for a while which are you on
 which phone are you on
 oh lay down on the floor for a while
 huh
 yeah
 oh yeah
 because of down below or because of that
 yeah
 yeah
 huh
 yeah
 yeah someday i'll be that way ha ha ha
 i got this itch to get some stuff done around the house again but you know the car's been coming first and now now we're going to need tires for the station wagon he's
 pointed out and and then nicole's car is going to have to have stuff on when she comes and everything goes outside and i'm just getting all sick of this again
 because he promised he was going to get s- done stuff done before confirmation well that came and went
 and oh well
 graduation i guess oh well
 only half the family's going to show up anyway come to think of it so what's the difference
 well because brad will get graduated the same day
 i'm sure you know
 i think the two westward ones will w- more than likely go east
 yeah and that's okay i don't care
 really
 well yeah to the thing after eventually but
 oh i'm sure linda will because they can't sit still long enough well maybe they will come to ours first and then zip over there and spend longer that might be the way it works
 i have to work
 so because i took off friday
 yeah
 so i didn't know for sure if you wanted me to go or not so i
 because you had said something about doug taking you and so
 huh
 no it's not it's your birthday
 i remembered that much
 so but
 uhhuh
 oh
 probably thought oh shoot
 yeah oh
 uh
 yeah
 yeah
 huh
 ace hardware okay
 okay
 okay here in
 here in norfolk
 okay
 all right
 you scared me when you said that though
 yeah
 yeah yeah
 uh well i would give it to doug
 yeah yeah
 yeah
 huh
 huh i got i got the t bs here
 huh what
 down in the basement
 yeah well air conditioner's kicked on too it makes it kind of hard to hear so if i say what what why then you know
 huh but no they had a convention to go to and another gal that was going to go with them
 but something came up she couldn't go and they said gee don't you want to get away and i said yes i do
 and things just been getting really stressful at work
 and then i take it at home and
 oh it's just in general i think i'm just getting to the point where i've had enough
 huh maybe it'll be better tomorrow
 so but anyway so jumped in the car friday morning and
 while they were at their convention i stayed in the motel room and cross-stitched
 it was fun
 so i hadn't done that for a long time they said are you sure that's what you want to do and i said uhhuh
 and then charlene's aunt was there and and she at one time had said i should have stayed back and cross-stitched with nila because she likes to cross-stitch too
 so they were a neat couple they're from ainsworth so
 just you know the ideal couple
 oh that
 yeah
 yeah
 what do you mean
 oh yeah
 yeah that'll be a interesting day
 oh i'm sure
 yeah
 so well they should show up to both

 white with like yeah
 uhhuh

 uhhuh oh so maybe we'll come for bess's briss we'll visit
 so when are you moving into mansfield
 wow
 very soon in three weeks
 three weeks
 wow
 so how's being home with brother
 with the brother
 mothers mother
 you're not mother how about the brothers the new
 studio guy how's your studio brother doing
 yeah he's cool
 did he make it did he w- did he meet wesley snipes already
 steven siegal anyone
 does he know like did he meet famous people yet
 uhhuh
 you could tell him he he could tell them that he met me that's enough
 i was really very very depressed because like whatever i was calling was at least
 yeah it was sold
 so whatever um
 whatever i was calling with nineteen hundred even like eighteen hundred and no one was
 no one wanted to go
 yeah why no one wanted to negotiate that was it
 finally um i don't know if you know them
 the last name is freed
 they were around he- i mean freed that's his name
 he's a caller guy he's like you know he's like
 they're really really good people
 i'm pretty sure he was around when you were here
 but um they own the whole thing
 and their downstairs neighbors
 who rented from them are moving out they bought a house
 this just happens all like three days ago
 so my friend told me about it and i was like there's noth- nothing to talk like
 can't afford it because mansfield
 they're massive and like
 i i looked on the ones in mansfield they're asking like over two you know
 twenty two that's the normal so um
 whatever i called her up is that and then they um
 whatever i tried haggling with them i told them i felt
 stupid but they told me they're asking eighteen fifty
 and like which is like which is a steal at what it is
 then i asked if there's any negotiating i just felt stupid the whole thing finally they came down to seventeen fifty
 but we still can't afford that so um
 like whatever like i called the husband one night
 and i was telling him that um i feel so stupid saying this i said but um
 you know so he didn't sound like you know you know you know because i know i know the place
 but um
 you know we could afford
 i said we could afford sixteen fifty in the beginning
 and eventually i'm saying right when like we're we're able to do a little more we'll go
 to seventeen fifty whatever he started he he goes thinking he told me he'd get back to me
 but he told me i should look at the place so i went to look at the place and it was gorgeous
 tremendous
 it's like twenty-six hundred square feet
 it's really nice
 and um
 it's three bedrooms but each bedroom
 i'm t- i'm i'm serious
 i'm serious guys each
 bedroom is the si-
 it's probably bigger than your master bedroom
 they're massive i'm telling you like
 like my bedroom is just going to get lost
 in there you know
 um
 whatever anybody calls back and he was still having
 and i i really didn't want to talk to him because i felt
 like it was a mess
 who him
 upstairs
 and they were they the thing is i really held out because
 i knew that they wanted us
 they w- they only want some people and we're like
 basically the only ones really really looking for a duplex
 everyone else all the like the
 caller people found them you know
 so
 whatever like people told me to you know like like
 be firm because they they
 probably would take you if
 but um
 i made call him
 a million times just because i i felt
 more comfortable with talking to him than me
 whatever then called me last night that they decided that um
 sixteen fifty for the first six months and then
 it'll cost us seventeen and that's it
 and that's like it's like
 a ton of money ton of money you know can you imagine i'm thinking like
 hopefully i'm talking like sixteen fifty seventeen i'm thinking i got the biggest
 deal but when you think about it
 at like what
 this is like d- more than double my mortgage you know
 but um
 for l a it's it's
 great
 right
 right
 i saw bess's house it's gorgeous
 you didn't go inside when you were here you he didn't
 he wasn't living there right
 it's beautiful
 the living and ar- i mean they did all the work
 to it already everything is finished
 yeah totally
 its a little different the shade but its nice
 like best
 yeah oh when you were there outside with
 it was nice
 they painted it white with like um
 like green bars or something
 like you know whatever i looked at it and i'm al-
 i'm so happy for him that he was able to buy a house
 but not for a second am i jealous it's a stupid
 thing like
 something like not to be jealous if
 because you know he said something like this like um
 you'll have a house in six months too something like that
 i'll think yeah right
 uhhuh

 so when you get it you know i just warned you
 because i'll probably forget to warn you again
 alrighty
 i found my watch just now
 see i'm going through my desk
 yeah
 it's a disney watch but i need a little loopy thing
 to hold the band down
 it's a hologram disney watch

 so i have to go we photocopied these things i'm going to mail them off again
 bunch of idiots
 huh
 the v a
 maybe
 and they cut everything
 they still they should still pay me
 because uh i need the money
 three hundred dollars
 yeah
 yeah because i have to buy some of the books
 and i had to pay tuition
 a hundred dollar deposit on tuition
 so
 that's what they owe me
 i have to pay fashion bug
 no they'll hand it to you
 they won't
 now usually your pell grant and everything as a last resort get a loan
 you know you should go for see if they have health information management there
 medical records
 medical records health information
 you should go for that
 yeah well nursing is too hard
 too much stress
 no i'm just kidding if you want nursing go for nursing
 uhhuh
 ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
 well actually there's like more
 what do you call it there's too many nurses now
 used to be not enough now there's too many
 so you might want to take that into consideration too
 there you go
 do special education teaching
 did you start your christmas shopping yet
 no we only got days i haven't started mine yet
 what did you get her
 uhhuh
 oh neat
 yeah
 uhhuh

 uhhuh
 now you get your sunglasses and then you got your watch
 the old phone book
 you got you sold all your candy
 p-
 alright put them in put them in your bag good we just sold twenty four candy bars in
 twenty four hours
 yeah
 if you want
 let's see there's m and m's plain and peanut there's
 reese's
 yeah there's
 yeah
 yeah
 wonder why they're behind
 wonder why they're behind
 probably because the fiscal year hasn't
 yeah
 yeah
 yep
 how much do they owe you
 oh wow that's a lot of money
 what's that for the whole semester or
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yep
 so if um
 i have a person for you i can get
 right now i ca- if i decide to i can get two thousand dollars for a student loan
 does that go into like a credit account
 or do they send me that money
 they will
 okay i was just wondering
 i haven't decided yet to get the loan but i'm going to
 yeah
 what's that
 what
 oh really
 yeah
 huh
 sorry i might
 i i mea- you heard it's kind of hard to get nursing here for
 when you first start
 nursing
 too much stress huh
 that's where i
 yeah
 somebody else told me i don't want nursing beca- well
 the person that told me she had tattoos up and down all her arms
 and stuff
 and
 then i talked to this little girl i babysit for her mom is a nurse
 and she goes
 to start out y- you're probably only going to get parttime
 because especially if you never nursed before they want to see how good or how bad you are
 that's what she said
 yeah
 yeah
 huh
 yeah
 i might become a teacher then
 but i still have to get all my basic stuff first anyway
 i might there's a lot of that going on here r- right now everybody i talk to is
 well not everybody i talked to but
 i know three or four people that
 uhhuh
 uh
 on purpose
 what did he to her
 huh
 okay
 huh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 like no attention for me
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 she said i don't appreciate
 uhhuh
 huh huh
 uhhuh
 uh uh uh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh that's funny so the cat said no attention for me
 oh yes they they
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 when they're mad right
 just looking at him
 uhhuh
 uh
 lawsuit uhhuh
 do you understand me
 i expend all this energy being really angry
 and um
 so i said you have to get up early and go to the laundromat
 of course there's ninety-two loads of clothes
 and the cat decided to piss in the middle of the bed
 because she was mad at daddy
 i told you he sleeps in the bare bed
 uhhuh she pissed in the middle of it
 on purpose
 uhhuh
 she was angry at him
 well
 he had came home oh this was a good one too oh i forgot this well you know me if you missed a day you've missed the whole chapter
 several chapters probably
 um
 i would say we're working on about
 two to three chapters a week
 minimum of two a week
 i'm talking seven days
 um
 he came home early
 night before last
 okay
 and i was i heard the door downstairs and girl i was over at that door i thought i don't know who the fuck that is but i'm going to kill them
 because you know what i'm
 and um
 so he pops in the door and i'm like
 what are you doing here
 i was sick babe
 you're sick
 oh
 what's wrong with you
 i felt dizzy
 dizzy
 right
 you know what i'm s-
 okay
 um
 and now that i look back
 he probably felt dizzy because that was the last day he had to sell any cars
 you know what i you know how he is
 don't you
 and so he hadn't sold anything so he probably made himself sick
 right or wrong
 am i right or wrong that's right
 so i said uhhuh i said what's really going on with you
 and i didn't even think to ask him oh you haven't sold any cars is that the problem i don't give a shit
 what difference does it make
 and um
 so yeah he came home early
 well that night he came early he petted the dog
 okay the dog was in his lap
 okay
 nibbles was over there in the chair
 looking at him
 watching
 uhhuh but see normally the cat goes to him right away
 and um
 so she didn't and um
 she was observing that
 uhhuh
 the next morning
 the bed had been dumped upon
 i said uhhuh
 making a statement are we nibbles
 okay
 right so i stripped the bed
 and i didn't make the bed and so then daddy goes this morning well i was going to bed last night no sheets
 i said well
 should've put some sheets on don't know what to tell you
 your cat pissed in the bed
 so i had to strip the bed
 okay
 he sleeps in the chair anyway so what's the difference
 right
 he does
 he sits is eh- uh sitting up in the damn chair so hey

 oh really she knew him
 does she think does she think he's cute
 okay well anyway did i tell you he took me out to dinner
 and um
 and then some
 you know restaurant place i don't even know
 but um
 it's called like it's in the this place called the galleria it's past south hills i don't know it's out there somewhere
 no like south hills village is the mall but um it's past there it's like r- around there though
 it's like fifteen minutes past there called the galleria it has like anne taylor and stuff in it you were probably there
 okay yeah well that's where we ate we ate at one of the restaurants in there i don't know what it was called
 huh
 cool but um
 i don't know and he was calling me for a while and stuff
 and
 i guess i kind of like him but there's
 he's very
 you know h- if he's rich he's very like proper and stuff and he thinks
 that uh he's always right and he has this thing about like
 you know how i joke around with people and like i'll make fun of them just jokingly though you know y- i won't say anything really mean but i'll just joke around
 but he takes it like so offensively and he always has to like back up like if i'm
 like this one i heard this story about him like trying to chase down this pizza guy one night whenever he was drunk
 and i'm like oh my god i'm like i heard about that and he's like and he comes up with this big excuse why he was
 doing it like you know like it wa- like he didn't make an ass out of himself or something and i'm just like i'm just joking take a joke you know what i mean
 and so but i don- but i did kind of like him and then he called me yesterday
 and he's friends with becky's roommate because they study together all the time and her name is megan
 she's really pretty she's really rich too and
 he called me and he goes megan
 and i'm like i think you have the wrong number tom and he's like oh emily
 i'm like yeah he's like oh i wanted to call you anyway and then he like started talking to me and i'm like oh i don't want to talk
 to him if he didn't like mean to call me you know what i mean
 so i'm like well i can't talk right now i'll give you a call back later on and i never called him back
 so today i had chem with him
 and he like didn't say one word to me i sit right beside him he just came in like he was sick so he came in took his quiz and left
 but he didn't say like like usually we talk before class and stuff and he didn't say like one word
 and i like tried talking to him and he totally ignored me and i'm just like what the fuck
 like i don't know if he thinks i'm mad at him or if he's pissed off at me for not calling him back or what but
 so i'm just
 in a bad mood all day today
 because i don't know what the hell his problem is and if he doesn't like me then i don't really care but
 you know that's no reason why we couldn't be friends or something like that like i don't know if it's
 that or what but i don't know why all of a sudden he just like
 i don't know all of a s- all of a sudden he's acting all weird
 pisses me off too
 that's why i don't like starting new relationships
 i haven't talked to him since well he called me last weekend and started screaming at me
 i don't know he's like i'm over you i don't need you anymore
 he was drunk it was like four thirty in the morning
 and i'm like
 that's right i'm like i'm like nick why don't you go drink another case of beer and then call me and see what you say and i like
 just hung up and ripped the phone out of the wall so like if he called back you know it wouldn't ring
 and um
 then he called me on sunday and apologized and then he was trying to make me feel bad for breaking up with him you know the usual guilt trip thing
 and i just hung up on him and i haven't talked to him since then
 but i i have the urge to call him right now
 like all day
 i kind of
 so once i come
 yeah like i don't uh but i don't know i kind of i don't know i just feel like talking to him
 it's weird because he's if he goes to new mexico i'll like never see him again
 i don't know
 just all stressed out plus finals are next week and uh

 uhhuh
 uhhuh

 yeah
 huh
 uhhuh
 aw how dear
 oh dear
 uhhuh
 oh uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 jon uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah uhhuh
 and and and like when you leave uh
 january ninth gwen will be staying right on at milton priory
 until
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah uhhuh
 yeah i
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 huh
 are those the names you talked about in your letters
 oh good
 one woman and one man
 uhhuh
 huh huh uhhuh
 would they necessarily take over milton priory uh wing like you did
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uh
 uh uh
 uhhuh
 oh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh anybody who suffers knows
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh huh
 yeah huh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh we hope that
 uhhuh
 you heard me say in my letter they'll never find two people like you i'm sure others have said it to you too
 does it like the two of you
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yes
 those three nights
 got it
 nobody else will know but you where i'm at
 okay
 well when you said you couldn't find dorset
 um we were three four days into our si- it's a county not a place
 oh well
 it's um it's in the southwest of england
 it's very beautiful
 you have a very beautiful place
 but this is um near york and in the yorkshire dales which are
 lovely national park area with
 small hills up and down up and down up and down
 very beautiful countryside
 well gwen's father that's why gwen went to york on my birthday she went the day before actually he wa- uh was moved on
 my birthday which is also his birthday
 for
 we we share our birthday
 from the uh hospital back to the nursing home
 and she wanted to help him settle back in
 um because for the time being he's back in his own room eventually he'll move into the nursing wing when there's room
 so her parents eventually will both be in the nursing wing
 but right now he's still in his room and her mother is in the nursing wing
 but it was a big ordeal getting him back so um
 you know she and and i could've gone along but it was
 it wouldn't have been a
 pleasant day for me
 plus we have the dog so you know
 so anyway uh that's what she did and that's what i did
 but he's doing
 i guess well
 for having had a severe heart attack
 but um he ca- he called her already this morning and said oh he feels so disoriented and
 i honestly think some morning he wil- they will just find him dead in bed
 he's ninety four
 you know he's a lovely man he phoned me that day
 to s- s- wish me a happy birthday
 once he got back to the nursing home because he felt bad he had gwen up there
 but um
 and her mother is
 probably as good as she's been in the last six months
 but they're both
 so frail
 but it's a big worry for gwen because she feels so responsible for
 not their physical care they're in very good hands
 but for some emotional support
 so anyway
 yes she will stay right where we're at
 um i mean in this little flat part of the priory i mean wing of the priory
 um she will make a lot of trips to york i'm sure you know um taking the dog with her
 she can stay right at the nursing home when she goes on her own
 they have you know spare rooms and so on so it's very easy for her once she gets there but travelling isn't easy
 especially in the winter
 um and then um in early march that we are having interviews again
 and we have two very good prospects this time
 and maybe by then some further back up we don't know because we don't
 yeah yeah and those two are both hanging in to explore
 and they would be excellent but they
 one woman and one man and he's in his fifties and she's twenty nine
 so they would be quite an interesting uh team
 and they wouldn't live together of course
 well o- one of them may pro- probably the couple the man and his wife
 may
 um but there's no requirement that they live in this wing
 uh a new community is forming in the priory
 a young ecumenical community
 and ruth if she comes may want to join that which means she would live in priory but somewhere else
 and also there's a house vacant just about oh five minutes away
 which the couple could have if they prefer
 he has a very severe back injury
 so he is
 somewhat limited in mobility
 he is a beautiful wonderful fellow
 um
 and i think his back injury has helped to make him so he's had it for some time
 so
 yes right and it has a lot to do with his spirituality
 so anyway um if they if they team up ruth would be sort of on the road the field person
 and he'd be the office
 wisdom guiding person
 so it would be quite different then the way gwen and i have handled it but we think it could work very well if they both agree
 he's i think he's more sure at the moment than ruth is because ruth is in scotland and loves it in scotland
 she's scottish
 and would have to move down so um
 anyway that's up for grabs
 but there is some hope that by march there will be staff
 well i mean i think it's very obvious that we created this thing
 and you know
 that's quite different from somebody else coming in and starting afresh but
 anyway we have had just really very good
 you got to start all over again
 okay
 ah i'm from philadelphia
 and i live in a co-op
 a co-op is not a condominium a condominium you buy
 a co-op you own shares
 now i'd better talk about the recycling those
 because they want us to
 oh they did oh okay what other topic would you like
 e- about philadelphia
 all right
 ah phila- if you've never been to philadelphia it is a wonderful wonderful
 town historically
 ah and
 what i like most of all is curtis institute of music and settlement
 music schools
 plus all the museums and the theater and the plays
 and ah
 i think once i was at york pennsylvania i have a
 yeah ah my cub scout leader
 i was a den mother
 and another boy scout who was an eagle scout
 is now working there with i be-
 y- i believe it's an electric company
 and he is wonderful
 and i've been saying i'm going to get up there to see him
 and his hobby is is trains
 and what is your hobby
 oh what college
 oh i didn't realize they had a campus there
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 but it that's what's good i like the word
 some objected to penn state here
 ah because it was much too large
 and so he didn't elect to go there
 and regarding the recycling
 i live in a co-op
 and we do separate
 everything
 ah we have separate one for newspapers
 and a separate one for
 cans and plastics
 but i do think that the streets
 near need more
 places
 to put things separate
 because they only have one can
 and there's a lot on the street where especially
 can sodas
 empty cans of soda should be available separate
 people go through the streets picking them out to get a few pennies out
 how do you find it in york
 oh so that they can't they can't recycle
 uhhuh
 i see
 uhhuh tell me what is york famous for historically or what do you find of interest in york
 hm uhhuh
 i see
 are we supposed to talk for any length of time this is my first call
 oh i see well i didn't look at the t- clock
 i guess we haven't lasted five minutes
 well about philadelphia again i just went to the
 i'm a volunteer
 for the ah
 philadelphia orchestra
 and i went to a concert where there was a
 piano soloist and it was very interesting
 and i always bring the program back for my next door neighbor who's a hundred years old
 and ah it has been f-
 really quite a a help for her
 and my other neighbor fell and i've been trying to help her
 because she can't get out well
 and it's not always easy because i'm a recycled teenager myself
 and so eh i have some problems on my own but
 i'm grateful for every day that i can move around
 and what is your what are you studying
 uhhuh
 right
 uhhuh
 you sound mature
 uhhuh
 have you do you get a chance to see much of the area that you live in
 uhhuh
 yeah baltimore has some wonderful museums if you like art
 plus the harbor
 but once you've seen it you know it the harbor itself
 they also have the wide screen ah
 theater
 like we have here in philadelphia
 uhhuh and it's not likely that you'll be coming here
 uhhuh
 well
 uhhuh i didn't even read this to see if we should tell anything but anyhow
 i i've i'm enjoying talking to you
 and this is my first call is it your first call
 i guess so
 ah
 um
 yeah i'm from york
 yeah
 wha- what is a co-op
 uhhuh
 yeah
 well they said we could ah choose a different topic if we want to yeah
 ah it doesn't matter we can just keep talking about
 yeah sure that sounds fine
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah it's a pretty small town
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 oh really
 ah i do different things um basically i'm
 mainly a student so i don't have other time for ah hobbies but
 i like to
 um i go to penn state york it's their campus of penn state yeah
 yeah they sure do it's it's
 pretty small campus it
 not much bigger than a high school
 uhhuh
 e- yeah
 yeah i'm
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 oh yeah
 mm
 yeah
 um actually it's hard to find a trash can in york so
 i mean r- yeah
 and they might and its just like if you're walking down the streets in york it's
 it's if you want to throw something away it's hard enough to find a garbage can then to
 then actually recycle any things
 um actually it's pretty yor- ah it's pretty small and um
 i don't know it's it's boring
 i don't know what to say but there's not much here so
 um no it's supposed to last for five minutes
 yeah
 no
 yeah
 ah
 yeah
 oh wow
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 oh yeah yes
 um i'm in a communications
 i'm thinking about a telecommunications actually
 so i'm not really sure what field i want to get into yet but it's pretty broad so
 um i try
 yeah
 so
 um yeah i there's not really a lot to see here
 i i've been to philadelphia once when i was little
 but ah i have to go down to baltimore and stuff like that its pretty close
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 oh yeah i i have some friends who go to school in philadelphia but
 i'm not sure what what school it is though
 no no uhuh
 um i'd like to v- visit there sometime you know but i've never
 i went out when the last time i was there i was really little i don't remember too much
 yeah
 yeah actually it's the first time i received
 ah much better much much better all right
 so i'm trying
 do you live in philadelphia
 oh
 ah-ha
 um-hum
 right
 what was the main concern there as far as
 you know were you concerned for your safety going out in certain areas or
 was it just
 uhhuh
 right
 right i heard about that
 uh-hum
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 well i mean it sounds like you you basically think that
 as it we should provide a deterrent you know by
 example
 kind of thing
 um
 my view is more
 that
 the social system has failed and
 that crime
 is an outgrowth of
 you know the economic system
 and the social system in this country and the forces
 at work i think it's
 inevitable that you would have crime in the system
 based on
 um the type of greed manipulation
 the capitalist system in based on
 i think you know as- inas long as we have
 this economic system and
 our social system that we have and
 those types of social control we have
 you know it's inevitable that we're going to have
 people resorting to
 means outside of what
 we consider acceptable
 to um
 provide for themselves and just as an outlet
 no
 well
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 so you don't think it's harsh enough
 uhhuh
 sure
 well we're seeing a lot of that lately you know
 if i get elected i'll build more prisons
 and you know i'll
 okay i've switched phones is that better
 okay
 no i live in state college
 um so
 i grew up in sacramento california though and
 i know um
 we have um
 a lot of crime there but not um
 like i've heard in philadelphia
 in fact
 um
 no we had um
 we had some like mass killings um
 you know gun men um
 there was a big massacre at a mcdonald's
 at the border of san diego and mexico one year
 and a school yard um
 but um
 and there were kind of a lot of
 ab- abductions children child abductions
 but as far as
 individual concern i ah mean i don't recall being
 afraid to go anywhere um
 but um
 i think our situation today
 as just a nation that we have um
 unprecedented um crime and
 um i think that our justice system has
 failed a lot to um properly punish
 criminals and um
 i think we need to to um have a lot more legislation to um
 increase sentences um to in- you know in-
 go back to the chain gang that you've been seeing on television
 i'm um
 i support capital punishment
 and um i
 i i firmly believe in in um
 justice in letting the the punishment fit the crime
 how about you
 right
 uhhuh
 are you talking more about like
 the inner city social
 um i mean the social system of
 the low- the lower class ah i mean
 when i look at crime i
 i guess a lot of crime that you
 would hear about or read about when you live in a big
 you know a metropolitan city like philadelphia there is
 ah mean i do hear a lot of like y- you know
 crime in the inner city and how um
 our social system has failed and and how um
 there's really no way out and so on and so on but
 i think when i look at crime
 i look at it as a whole
 and i i
 i think um
 we've done too much
 i mean they've made a big mess
 of of that whole thing but i i
 i don't know i tend to look at crime as um
 as that our justice system has failed you know i mean
 if you look at the early days of
 of um punishment and
 and jails and you read about the con- kind of conditions that
 you know they started making realizing that they couldn't just
 throw everyone into dungeon type things without
 proper um
 um
 health conditions and
 separating the the women
 from the men and then you know we've just
 we've completely taken away the um
 the meaning of what it of of
 prison i mean you go there because you're
 you're you're um you've
 committed a crime
 and um
 i i um i think
 exactly uh it might be a combination of just of both
 uh you know our social system failing to um
 provide uh um
 you know equality providing a equal way out for
 people t- to um
 to grow and to be educated and to
 to um change the way
 um
 ignore_time_segment_in_scoring 283 21 283 90 a right
 i also think that um
 there is um
 so much politics involved
 with just punishment you know people don't
 right
 right
 is that what we are supposed to do okay
 mm i don't know yeah there's a huge problem with the public school system
 yeah
 the main problem is tha- because they get t- ah teacher's tenure
 and then they stop teaching after they get their tenure and it doesn't matter if they can't get rid of the teachers
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 what college do you go to
 yeah
 york college of pennsylvania
 a junior
 what's your major
 ah
 i have a double major too
 physical science and chemistry and nuclear medicine
 it's fun
 hope
 political science won't do anything for you will it
 political science won't do much for you will it
 unless you're going into politics you still have to go to graduate school
 become a lobbyist
 become a lobbyist
 oh sorry
 i said you could become a lobbyist
 well the school system
 yeah i had some pretty
 what
 yeah
 our high school teachers were pretty bad too did you go to school in new york
 oh my god
 yeah i went to school in new york we had pretty shoddy teachers
 you went to a did you go to a private school or a public
 yeah
 well connecticut what do you expect
 new jersey so you're close to school
 yeah
 excuse me
 yeah i know going from extremes to
 mild
 we go- our school got cancelled a whole bunch of times this winter
 yeah they cancelled like five times this year
 because these people in pennsylvania are frigging it gets like a little snow they cancel it or delay it for half a day
 because it we're alm- i'm like we're almost in pennsyl- or ah
 maryland it's right on the border the mason-dixon line
 yeah
 like when they had that there was a huge snowstorm this year
 the sch- ah the high schools that are around here they closed down for a whole week straight
 do you know what the point of this whole thing is
 yeah that's the way i had to do it
 this our whole fraternity is doing this
 of course
 yeah
 yeah too many people come out of it illiterate
 and don't even know how to read
 let alone how to function in society
 yeah if they stink you can't fire them because they've got tenure
 and then there are those teacher's unions
 teachers can just walk out of the classroom without
 even thinking about students
 students are no longer important just your salary and covering your own behind
 ah rutgers
 what college do you go to
 oh
 what year are you
 i'm a sophomore
 um a double major math and history
 in what
 ouch
 yeah i m- m- math isn't that easy
 but it'll get me employed when i get out of school
 i hope too
 what
 um
 yeah
 what
 mm
 i'm sorry i still don't understand you
 well i'm not interested in anything like that
 yes
 i'm i'm definitely a product of
 the inadequacies of public school
 i was learning disabled student and i had to get out of the l d program
 or i'd be stuck in those stupid remedial classes
 where you learn nothing
 no actually i'm from connecticut
 yeah
 well i was part of those preppy little schools
 where only the smart students counted and if you had any sort of learning difference or if you were
 dumb you were stuck in these stupid classes and when
 i went to public school but they were all like college prep schools
 my town was a want to be darien or greenwich
 yeah
 i no longer live in connecticut my parents moved to um
 princeton new jersey
 yeah now they're moving to charlotte north carolina
 that should be fun
 no more winter
 no more winter
 oh yeah
 and of course when it snows out school gets cancelled
 of course the only time rutgers ever closed was maybe during the civil war
 oh we didn't have a single cancellation
 it was amazing
 i think it closed two times in the summer of the winter of
 ninety four ninety three ninety four but that's about it
 oh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 i remember when i went to school up in connecticut we only closed five times during the
 during the last year of school and it was snowing like crazy
 everybody else closed ten or eleven times
 five snow days that was it
 at least i got to graduate early
 uhhuh
 doesn't surprise me makes me kind of glad i was on vacation
 i could just stay at home and do nothing of course i got cabin fever
 um
 i don't know i'm just doing it because i need to raise money for my singing group
 yeah i think they're studying our voice
 speech patterns
 and the whole rutgers university is doing this
 we're so broke we need some money
 alright hold on hold on hold on
 hello
 okay i'll tell you what i think
 i think that euthanasia
 well i think first of all that everybody should have a living will and it says you know what you think
 about if you are on a respirator at some point what do you think
 needs to what
 everyone needs to
 i agree
 so then let's just say that someone doesn't i guess
 because we both agree on that
 all right let's say it's somebody who
 right
 wow
 what did most people around there think
 because they said she should stay right
 right hold on will you turn the music down real quick
 right
 what did the community think
 right
 how long had it been
 right
 right
 she did
 for how long
 wow
 yeah what do you think about him
 right
 why what happened
 as far as like euthanasia goes
 okay
 yes
 well i have a living will
 states very clearly what i want which is
 t- not very much
 and i think everybody hates to do that
 needs needs to decide uh just what it is they want and then put it in writing
 well
 uh
 i think it's really depends on the case uh
 you remember the the quinlan case
 well i went to school at roxbury high school with karen anne quinlan
 and
 uh the party happened about uh
 oh block and half from my house so i don't know i guess
 at the time that was that was very new and very
 oh there was a lot of uh uh heavy catholic population in that area and
 her family had an uphill battle all the t- all the time with that
 well at on- at the the case finally came down to they wanted to take her off the respirator uh
 her family wanted to
 um they had to go to court to get permission to do it
 i i'd say it was uh by that point i think there was a fair amount of support
 because uh you know it was obvious that uh nothing else was ever going to happen
 it had been a couple of years before they asked to take uh oh maybe not even that
 let me see it happened in uh
 seventy five
 yeah i guess it was a couple of years before it went to uh they wanted to disconnect her from the respirator because there was no hope
 and then uh it dragged on in court for another couple of years before they could finally do it
 and uh
 then she fooled everybody anyway and stabilized
 yeah when they disconnected her from the sta- from the respirator she uh
 faltered and then stabilized
 oh she lived for another three years or something
 i kind of watch this kevorkian character wi- kind of watching to see
 um
 i think that people need to have a choice
 and that it should be up to them to decide uh him himself i don't know about uh
 i've kind of got mixed feeling on to uh his whole his his professed public reasons and and his uh history for when he was a practicing pathologist
 uh he just uh
 i don't know he seemed to be uh uh
 uh preoccupied with uh
 i don't want to say shady but uh borderline cases even when he was a practicing physician going back back as far as medical school he
 had some unusual uh traits
 well just in the kind of things that he uh w- uh
 was wanted to be involved with and was involved with this he uh were more the abnormal cases than uh normal
 what do you think
 right
 right exactly uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 no i agree with you i definitely uh i i didn't see why
 it shouldn't have been just uh
 legal in the first place i don't why they made all the rules and laws against it
 yeah but still uh cigarettes uh get you high uh
 alcohol gets you high
 uh a lot of um
 over the counter medicine can you get you high if you do it right coke can get you high
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 true
 you're right are you a student
 um
 where were you going
 oh
 oh uhhuh
 um
 i'm a i'm an an older person so i finished school
 i teach uh
 english as a second language
 uhhuh yeah
 love it it's a great uh if you're looking for
 uh something to go into it's a really a nice
 uh profession
 i do it with adults
 that means if you like kids
 you can do it with kids too
 uhhuh
 i don't see why not i think it's a
 uhhuh and also uh when you're doing uh chemotherapy
 there's a lot of nause uh you've get very very nauseas
 oh uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 oh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh
 oh
 oh my god
 oh that's terrible
 cool
 well
 with the way
 i say ah you know what i think um
 it should be legalized because we never had no problem like that when people were because people were smoking cocaine and crack
 we never had all this robbing and stealing when they was just smoking marijuana
 you know and people you can walk down the street and see the people um who is like
 has it like has been doing it for a long time
 and you can tell when they had some and they're they call them schizen when they're
 eyes is glazed over
 they look like devilish
 you know and i think yeah
 i think it should be uh what do you think about that
 because it's a drug and it got that t h c in it that's what gets you high
 same thing uhhuh
 yeah
 they say uh when you do marijuana it slows your brain wave pattern up
 but they never say what um
 and they just say that crack makes your brain sizzle
 like fry your brain away
 because a lot of people can't afford cocaine
 they can afford crack
 but then
 and people that can afford crack can afford marijuana
 and and if they gave them marijuana instead of crack
 then we won't have all these problems
 mm well m- um i'm in between schools
 i went to um community college i got
 i got a um
 certificate of business management
 and how about you
 okay
 okay
 oh you teach english as a second language
 oh
 yeah
 oh
 yeah
 yeah i read that they're going to need a lot of um
 um teachers for um
 uh grade children because of all the immigrants that's coming in you know
 but um now okay back to the topic now do you think it should be prescribed for medicinal medicinal purposes
 they said it helps for glaucoma
 yeah
 yeah because i i used to work in the hospital in the dietary section
 and it would be some people would come in on a weekend for chemo and then we have um i was on the terminally ill floor
 and it would be just a shame to see the people going through chemo
 and they couldn't eat i mean they couldn't even eat jello
 and you know and they were just like taking
 um they called it like um ice chips because they they couldn't even keep anything down they would just suck on ice
 and i mean you know they i mean they could not eat at all
 and they felt so nauseas and just the smell of food alone
 would really get their stomach upset now
 the affect that marijuana has you know when you smoke it
 um they say i mean they they get the munchies
 right which was just like an increase in appetite
 so it may help settle settle their stomach
 plus it may give them
 an uh uh a s- a small appetite where they can
 you know eat something instead because i had seen them when they can't
 they even um like orange sherbet we don't we wouldn't give them ice cream but we give them sherbet
 or clear liquid tray which is like um beef or chicken broth jello um juice
 that's apple cranberry right and um they'll have hot tea
 and they can't get that down so even if they h- uh puffed on the marijuana and they were going through chemo
 right and it would help them
 put something in their stomach because they go days
 days yeah oh you just don't know i have seen a lot because i was just i d- did three years at jefferson hospital in the
 dietary department and my floor was um
 excuse the term the workers called it death row
 because everybody was terminally ill if they went home they would come back
 and they would just go home and come back until they would like maybe expire or something
 you know so i seen people like you know just wither away
 i know you sh-
 hello
 hi my name is jung yen
 hi i'm so i'm so glad i finally got through it's so hard to get to somebody sometimes when you're
 yeah i mean i i just i i um
 the first call that i made the five calls that they tried
 i none of them were taken and then i just i tried to do
 i just tried to do it again and so i'm so glad were
 where are you
 are you i'm at penn state
 uhhuh
 yeah um it it i think it's nearing its end i don't go to school anymore so but i'm calling from
 from the area so uh do you go to school in philadelphia
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 great what do you study
 great
 uh that's what i got my um undergrad in
 my bachelors in yeah
 well i last year i got my masters
 in um
 in counseling
 yeah and i worked temporarily on
 um at penn state
 with temporary job and um i'm
 kind of um been in
 you know i i haven't been working for the last few months
 but um i've got a summer j- job that i've done for the last
 you know for two years before to have supervisor positi- you know like
 um responsibilities this time and um so
 that's that's what i'll be doing for now then i'm going to t- i'm going to try to teach english abroad
 uh at penn state
 great
 well i think it's hard to find jobs for everybody you know no matter what field so um
 but um i i think it's uh it's becoming more popular you know counseling as a as a
 degree that's what i've noticed
 um so but uh
 you know are y- y so you're you're interested in ah counseling or education or
 uhhuh uh counseling in terms of um like mental health
 or rehabilitation or
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah uhhuh
 yeah i had um yeah in terms of educational or career counseling the program that i um
 i i i did um pretty much trains you a lot along those lines you know um and
 um i and um with mediation i think there's g- there's mediation programs around i know that um one of the things that i took as a
 as a a grad student here was a a mediation uh seminar
 and i got certified in mediation
 and it it it i don't i don't think it matters what specifically what the topic is that because um they they
 they tried you you learned about conflicts
 i- in a general sense and then you try to you know work with different conflicts you know a- and um
 and um so i i think it's a good program but it's it's i understand it's becoming more and more
 you know common in a different counseling areas so you might look into different programs
 yeah
 oh it it y- it just says you're certified i don't i don't n- know what that does you know in the big picture it's
 yeah yeah it was a seminar for you know it it um they did it on one gigantic weekend that's all you did and um so
 but that's what it means you're certified so but um
 yeah and uh i mean i i i always i i feel pretty good with my my um counseling skills so my um
 uh i i i feel that like i could i could be uh a mediator but it always takes practice anything does and so um i i don't know what
 you know what it really means to be certified if you're not really practicing you know so um but anyway um
 hopefully in korea
 you know an-
 hi
 uh hi my name is mimi or
 really yeah i i haven't had much luck with getting people either
 yeah a-
 oh i'm in philadelphia
 yeah
 oh you are
 oh okay i i thought that penn state um semester was over
 oh okay
 uhhuh
 well um i i actually i go um to school part time they have
 the university of pennsylvania has something called the college of general studies
 which is like uh an evening school
 so i'm i'm taking courses there
 and
 uh psychology
 oh really
 oh so so what are you doing now
 oh yeah
 uhhuh uhhuh
 yeah
 oh w- w- where did you get your master's degree
 oh uhhuh yeah well actually i'm thinking of getting a master's degree in counseling also
 but uh i don't know do do you think it's hard to find jobs
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 more counseling yeah
 well
 well i'm i'm not really sure i i have a a couple of ideas i actually work um i'm a librarian
 and i i work at a um psychiatric hospital
 so i you know i've i've been doing that for seven years and i read a lot of of books about child
 psychology and psychiatry and stuff like that it's also part of my job
 um so for a for a while there i i thought i wanted to be a therapist but now i'm
 i'm not so sure and and now i'm thinking
 i'm i'm thinking
 of possibly some kind of educational or career counseling
 or alternatively i'm also kind of interested in
 maybe um family counseling or marriage counseling um
 and and i'm kind of interested in the idea of some kind of mediation like divorce mediation or or you know something like that
 so i'm considering all those possibilities
 uhhuh
 oh really
 uhhuh
 right
 uhhuh
 yeah yeah so so what what does it mean to be certified in mediation
 but it was was that just as a result of taking one course you get that
 uhhuh
 oh uhhuh
 oh okay that's interesting
 uhhuh
 uhhuh right
 so what where are you going to be teaching english
 uhhuh
 that's right i a- i always just waited for some reason
 didn't quite ca- i i pressed one when it said it
 but i guess that means press one once you start talking
 i see i see
 um so ah do you want to talk about the topic or
 okay yeah so um what do you study at um u penn are you an undergraduate student
 a what major
 oh psychology how do you like it
 yeah
 really um well e- ah actually i work um
 i've worked in that field actually even though i didn't i majored in sociology and anthropology
 i went to wesleyan university in connecticut
 um but actually i worked as a uh
 residential counselor at mental health um facilities
 and actually my current job is in philadelphia and i work with
 uh families um
 it's something called services for children in their own homes and i work with families that
 ah for whatever reason have been referred to the department of human services
 are you familiar with d h s it called
 yeah were you um i'm sure you've heard of like the
 cases where you know a child that was adopted or a child that is
 the parents had abused it and then they ended up killing it and
 this particularly in new york and they end up blaming some
 you know ah some government agency for not taking the kid away
 okay well that's that's kind of what i'm working i kind of work
 well that that ah government agen- ah agency actually contracts our services to
 kind of be in the home and make sure the parents aren't killing the kids or whatever
 but um but they we're so we're in court
 quite often and actually there are a lot of lawyers that um
 that do ah that work specifically in the family court
 uh and that's pretty interesting actually um
 so if you become a lawyer you can always look into it
 look into that um although i'm sure it doesn't pay nearly as much as um most other things ah
 really
 yeah
 hell well shit hell i've been out of school four years and i still don't know
 what i want to do so
 so
 what
 yeah
 oh really
 yikes
 you haven't you haven't been asleep since last night have you
 oh okay well it must have been a good night
 you were just what
 oh okay w-
 well that's a good place to lose precious hours
 yeah yeah definitely
 wow
 oh
 are you is it under control or are you got to
 well that's good
 for um
 so actually i did see a i did speaking of the movie thing i did
 see a good movie last night actually i saw the um
 dead man walking
 have you seen that
 um it is it is it is pretty good
 huh
 right and actually has sean p- sean penn in it as well
 but um i live out in west chester
 there is a two dollar movie theater
 really what did you see
 oh my god that is my one of my all time favorite movies
 really um
 really
 yeah i've i've watched i've seen that movie
 i don't usually see a movie more than once but ah
 that one i've seen several times and actually
 anytime someone i end up talking about it and someone hasn't seen it you know i'm like
 oh my god you've got to see that movie
 so yeah that i loved that movie the book
 yeah
 oh really
 yeah after the re- i think it's after the machine ah or whatever i don't know exactly e-
 whatever it doesn't matter
 ah yeah i'm an undergrad i am a psych major actually
 psychology
 yeah
 um i like it pretty good
 yeah i actually i'm not going to be a psychologist probably but ah
 i'm probably going to end up being a lawyer but
 uh
 okay yeah
 um actually well a lit- a little bit not very much
 right
 right
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 right
 i don't know i was i was actually thinking about international law
 but i don't know exactly what i want to do i'm j- it's still kind of fuzzy
 i'm just a sophomore so i have time
 oh
 oh my god
 oh my go- i just looked at the time
 because i just woke up
 and it's four thirty
 wow
 ah well i've been asleep actually since this morning i i didn't
 i actually didn't go to sleep last night i went to sleep around ah
 nine thirty ten ten o'clock this morning
 ah actually no i was just surfing the web
 just surfing the web
 i don't know i
 y- i had no idea how long it w- i was on there it just
 you just lose track of time so easily
 anyway i don't know what i'm going to do now i mean
 my schedule's off and i'm in the middle of finals
 yeah finals are i have had two of them and i have like ah two to go
 well it wasn't under control last week
 now it's pretty much under control since
 the two the two finals that i was al- most worried about are over
 so
 oh really
 no is that g- is it really good
 that's susan sarandon right
 that's susan sarandon
 oh okay
 i saw a movie last night too that was really good
 the unbearable lightness of being
 really
 yeah i saw it for the first time last night on showtime
 it was really good
 i thought it was extremely long but for some reason it was re-
 mm okay
 i've had that topic before
 yeah well
 like do you want to talk about it
 well maybe we can find something better to talk about
 oh at u of penn
 okay you're the first one that i've talked to that's not at from penn state
 yeah
 well my name is arlene and i'm i'm at rutgers
 yeah
 um right i'm working at the douglas campus but i graduated um
 from the rutgers college um
 from rutgers college in eighty three
 and i'm going to enter the graduate program in counseling psychology this fall
 yeah well rutgers um will pay my tuition because i work here so
 oh please plus th- that was like my very first topic
 what are you what are you in
 physics oh my
 goodness
 isn't that isn't that ivy league
 ooh boy i'm impressed in physics
 well i'm i'm sure it was harder to get into than other schools
 are you doing what are you doing masters
 so they don't have like a terminal masters program
 oh that's that's how it is with the psychology program here
 they don't give you a masters
 you have to go straight for your p h d
 but and they don't want you to go
 part time they want you to go full time
 so that was just out for me i couldn't
 yeah
 right
 right but the only reason i can go is because i can get free tuition
 and i only get that by working full time
 so i'd have to quit my job and i can't do that
 so i'm doing this through the school of education
 has this counseling psychology masters
 so i'll see about that
 what do you want to do with this
 degree
 teach
 yeah
 really
 right right
 why is that why particularly in physics or is it just the sciences in general
 oh no
 really
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 really
 right
 uhhuh
 hi
 have you i've never had it before
 hm
 that's fine with me i don't know how strict these topic requirements are i assume that
 they were actually vaguely interested in the topics but maybe it's just an excuse to give us something to talk about
 okay well hi my name is bill i'm a grad student at the university of pennsylvania
 yes university of pennsylvania
 yeah apparently most of the people involved in this program are at penn state but uh
 i uh i don't know there's a
 linguistics student here who seems to have been hunting around for people i don't know how many they found but uh
 oh really
 which campus
 ah
 oh really
 ah no wonder you're so bored with advice about choosing colleges
 i'm in the physics program here
 yeah studying materials physics i sort of
 on the edge between material science and engineering in the physics department
 yes yeah university of pennsylvania is
 well
 it's uh i don't know not
 not necessarily that different from other schools in the area
 yeah in some cases um
 no i'm in a gra- uh p h d program they they don't give very many masters degrees in physics it's like
 if you're going to if you're going to get an advanced degree you probably want to do research and if you want to do research in physics you pretty much need a p h d
 uh let me think i always forget the terminology they have if you try to get a p h d and fail out they give you a masters degree so that
 not considered a terminal masters
 is it
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 well it takes so long to get a p h d my gosh i mean
 part time it's takes
 many many many years it's it's like
 right right yeah
 yeah yeah well that makes sense
 mm
 i'm not exactly certain at this point i sort of came in thinking i wanted to just be a physics professor somewhere but
 it uh
 it turns out that i've discovered
 a couple of factors one being that
 it's really really hard to get academic jobs in physics even in physics which is like
 better funded than most of academia those professorships are few and far between
 you know maybe you can get a lecturing job somewhere but to get it
 a you know a secure tenure track job is really really tough
 i don't know if it's harder in physics than in the next thing i mean generally speaking the
 you know the job market i get the impression for all professors is really
 tight
 and uh there's there's actually
 sort of a glut of
 physicists there there have been all these
 myths you hear over the years about how
 the sputnik era physicists are going to be retiring and they're going to need lots of new physicists
 and
 lots of other things and and basically they haven't panned out what what's happened is
 the american physical society always encourages the government to
 set aside more and more funding for more and more physics graduate students
 and each professor has several graduate students and they all get p h d's and they all want to be professors and they have several graduate students
 and it doesn't take that long before you have too many physicists now fortunately physics is a background where people can go into industry or whatever it's you know it's got
 a variety of
 of outlets there's a lot of physicists
 that end up going into
 biology of all things and tons of physicists are on wall street
 doing programming analysis of one sort or another
 yeah actually it's caused like a
 big stir because
 the- they're using such sophisticated mathematical models that most of the
 business people on wall street don't really know what's going on with them
 and it apparently has caused some major
 problems if
 something goes wrong with the model and
 the i don't know there's two there's two different cultures on wall street now there's kind of
 i forget what they call them the quants and the quantifiable
 quant stands for quantitative
 reasoners or something
 hi who am i speaking with
 uh hi tom i'm jerry are we going to discuss cooking or what
 ah well i do like i like do like cooking i like to eat in and out
 what about yourself
 ah what kind of foods do you like
 do you okay what kind do you like
 salmon oh that's good how do you like that grilled or
 just baked yeah
 ah okay did you ever taste salmon cakes
 yeah you make them you know like um
 god you put egg in them and parsley and a little bit of cheese and bread crumbs and then you mix the sa- you ca- you buy the salmon in the can
 and you mix it all up and then you eh roll it in bread crumbs and fry them they're very good
 yeah uhhuh
 uh no not really i just seen the recipe in um in the newspaper none that i know of really
 yes i am are you from
 oh what part of new york
 oh how is it out there is it as rough as ever
 oh you haven't been back but i heard it's pretty bad now huh
 yeah well it's pretty bad all over it's unfortunate that you live in a world like we do
 uhhuh what kind of work do you do
 oh that's great that's very interesting what do you teach
 oh that is real interesting oh
 oh really oh really
 oh i- is is she kara
 oh okay i didn't talk to alex i talked to kara oh okay so she she manages this whole program
 yeah it's very interesting you know when i saw the ad i had to answer it is this something that they do on uh a yearly basis or is this something new or
 uhhuh
 yeah uhhuh
 right and
 right that one a day right you have to make one a day right
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 isn't that amazing
 now that is really amazing ah
 now uh you've only had to make five calls but you also have so- five people have to call you isn't that the way it works
 and um what happens like if these people like didn't always reach you then what
 no but i mean like for these other people ah because like how many people
 okay they can only make one a day how many people actually participate in the whole program
 uhhuh
 oh really is it that many so this
 oh my goodness that is something and it's until june right
 is there eh s- da- she told me she didn't know the specific date eh a person that i called i was wondering when in june
 oh by june first okay
 yeah
 oh it is because i had told her like you know if i tried a couple phone booths
 and they didn't have like any call back numbers
 and she said you can make up a number
 yeah well i that's what she told me i left it right on the table that's
 one of my questions and she called back
 because a lot of these uh
 uh phone booths don't have any you know call back numbers
 she said you can just put in a number but i didn't i don't that didn't sound right
 yeah right
 maybe that's what she probably meant yeah yeah
 right so that is really interesting so this is like a new project this is not something they've tried before
 oh and whose idea w-
 okay how did they come up with this this is very interesting i'm very curious
 uhhuh
 oh
 oh
 uhhuh
 right
 uhhuh uhhuh
 boy that it it it's unbeliev-
 hello
 uh i'm tom
 well it's up to you
 uhhuh
 uh well i do too as well
 um well i really do like fish
 yes i really do
 uh i guess my favorite fish is salmon
 right
 no just baked just baked very simple i like whole flavor of the fish
 no
 uhhuh uhhuh
 oh really no i've never had that is that a specialty of a region
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 right well are you from philadelphia
 okay yeah well i i i yes i'm originally from new york but i've been in philadelphia for a very long time
 uh brooklyn new york
 i haven't been back in a long time
 i think so
 i think so
 yeah it certainly is yeah it's certain
 um i teach at drexel university
 english
 right actually it's my daughter who's managing this whole program this whole switchboard program right
 and so she's recruited all the members of the family to participate
 no alex
 okay okay
 yeah
 well i think um what they're trying to do is is develop um eh you know voice recognition technology
 and so you know we're being recorded and
 and i think the the agreement is that you will make five calls
 right and you can make more but you'll have to make it at le- that minimum and and then
 yes right right
 and then at the end of the this whole um you know period when they're recording everything
 they're going to try to develop the technology in such a way that you know just one or two words from you
 ah put into a computer
 would then result in the computer's identifying every other conversation that you had
 yeah
 that's right that's right
 that's right
 well that's okay i mean you you still get you know the the the hourly i mean the the hourly the the minute by minute rate
 well they can only make one a day too
 i'm actually not sure bu- i mean i- it's hundreds and hundreds
 yeah yeah i think it's over seven hundred people
 until june exactly
 i think they actually want most of the calls made or all of the calls made by june first
 um but uh in in in any case it's you know it's good bit of time
 uhhuh right
 oh really
 oh
 huh
 uhhuh
 sure
 sure
 uhhuh
 well i don't know i mean eh as long as you keep changing the number it's probably all right
 i mean maybe the system can't tell what's a real phone and what isn't
 right so if you use this thing number twice it probably wouldn't take it the second time
 oh no they've never done this before
 and it just started you know a couple of weeks ago three weeks ago maybe
 uh i'm not exactly sure how it started i know that when my daughter first went to work for the uh the l d c
 um they were working on a project for um communications companies
 that we're providing you know funding
 uh for the improvement of um
 you know telephone communications and
 a- any kind of voice communication whether it's on telephone or not
 i pressed one
 oh all right
 yes nearly all the time
 i'm from philadelphia
 yeah
 there's a subway and the buses
 yes
 it is
 as far as
 well just be on your guard is about all you can do
 yeah
 yeah it's not bad
 oh it's much too expensive
 that's why i try to get my work done in the mornings so i don't have to pay to come back home
 well you see w- i'm a senior citizen
 and peak hours you have to pay the price
 yeah
 i don't
 well off peak hours is free and we have a card
 otherwise it's a dollar and a half or a dollar sixty
 oh my god when
 isn't that awful
 it is
 that terrible that's the highest anywhere i think
 awe well i don't know anything about new york i mean or or anyone else i mean anywhere else but
 i know ah i try to get my work done between
 off peak hours
 so ah are you in school
 oh uhhuh
 oh i see
 uhhuh
 well maybe you can help me
 ah my phone will ring call for edith williams
 and that's it it cuts off all of the
 they keep telling me keep my phone on tone i keep it on tone it's the same thing if i keep it on tone or off tone
 oh i have many times
 and about nine o'clock each morning i get a call and that's all i get
 you know
 call for edith williams and then it cuts off
 okay
 um my home phone number
 three eight seven
 two four one zero
 edith williams
 see almost every morning around nine o'clock or so i'd hear the phone and well there it goes again
 yes for edith williams and then it cuts off
 yeah
 well i have to wander around to find a different phone
 i'm using public phones now but i have to try to find one that you know that isn't noisy
 right now i'm in the post office building
 it's not too bad
 you mean other calls
 oh yes
 no no no it's the calls that come into my number
 because i can only use my home phone number once which i've done
 no the calls that come into my phone
 yeah i'd appreciate that because every morning i well here it goes again
 well
 i'd like to get through because i haven't got
 okay so now we're ready to talk
 do you u- do you use the public transportation system
 and is it where are you from
 oh okay so we're both going to be talking about the same public transportation system
 uhhuh uhhuh
 yeah it's pretty easily accessible
 it's safe
 i mean it's about as safe as anything else in philadelphia right
 yeah right
 i think it's pretty good actually
 not as good as new york i think it's a little too expensive
 yeah
 right
 get it done in the morning so you don't have
 yeah
 oh that's right that's right
 right
 so if you get on the bus
 during off hours you don't pay at all or you just pay you pay less
 oh that's good
 all right
 dollar sixty and it's going to go up to two twenty five or something like that
 soon is what they're saying
 yeah within the next couple months
 i really don't know what a lot of people who are on
 fixed incomes but who aren't senior citizens are going to do that's going to be really awful
 even people who are working jobs
 but they don't make a lot of money um an increase like that is a real problem
 yeah i don't think that it's much higher anyplace else in the country if you want to know the truth
 yeah
 ah no i'm not a student i actually work at the university of pennsylvania
 in fact i work on the in the um
 office where this particular database is being put together
 of people who are making these telephone calls
 and um so i mean
 you know um
 what go ahead
 oh is that right
 so you've complained about this before
 oh that's bizarre
 oh that's really bizarre um
 just a minute let me find out if they know anything just a minute
 the technical people aren't here but
 you know if you give me your um
 your phone number and your name then i can try to call you back
 and see whether or not they found a solution to the problem
 yeah
 uhhuh
 okay what's your first name
 okay
 all right well i know that they were working on some
 bizarre bugs
 um and it may just be that they found a
 whatever kind of solution for this problem that they needed so
 um i'll have to try and get them in touch with you to see whether or not
 yeah
 and this and and then it says e- hello this is switchboard
 yeah
 it cuts off right afterwards
 oh my god that is really strange um okay
 but you can make calls you just can't get them is that it
 okay
 right
 right
 right but i mean people haven't been able to call you
 is that right since your phone rings
 oh i see what
 yeah you're saying
 okay so people can call you you're saying that that it's the calls that you make from your number
 from your own home number
 okay all right
 right right
 okay
 all right i'll have to try to find out whether or not they
 figured out what's wrong with this this is really strange oh that's re-
 right i know it's kind of that's kind of um a nuisance isn't it
 it
 hello
 hello
 hi how are you doing
 i'm mike hi what's your name
 a- excuse me
 amy hi amy where are you at
 you are in washington d c
 wow
 i'm in jersey
 yeah where do you go
 excuse me
 do you go to howard yeah i'm at rutgers
 i should be finishing up at the end of the summer
 excuse me
 ah in sociology
 i don't know
 i don't know i hope i can do something with it you know
 i got a lot of feelers out already
 we got a big job fair coming up on the end of the month
 but i went to this place
 um like a temp agency i figured well what the heck
 at least i get myself some experience you know
 and ah i g- i'm in the process of trying to teach myself how to do excel
 and its like kind of tough but i mean i had i had computer science in ah my classes
 and ah of course we use claris works which is totally different from what this is you know so i got to unlearn everything you know
 yeah so if i can get that than i'll get a nice little position at a t and t as a temp but still
 uh its a good job you know
 actually no
 but it'll be a a sociology
 actually it can lateral to any field
 it's sort of like a middle of the road stance where you can go in any direction
 now if i were to go into library science or something like that which i was interested in
 ah it would fall right in place or i could get in any position in any government job you know
 or a state government you know unemployment office
 denied
 ah i really was strongly thinking of it ah g p a is right up
 there g r e's are good and ah all i'm thinking of i'm i i owe so much money
 and i have to do something about that so
 i don't know got to do something so maybe i'll take some time off and
 do some work and if i go back i might even go back in the evenings like you know
 how about yourself do you go full time
 wow what's your major
 african studies that's good
 yeah that's that's that's one i wanted to take one of those classes they had over here
 yeah i i it sort of like conflicted with
 a couple other classes and i waited for the next semester and
 by then they offered a a s- el supremo class that i really wanted to get into an i says well i'll take that one instead and
 some other time and here i'm all ready to graduate now you know so
 oh well what are you going to do well you get a
 sufficient amount of overlap from all the other classes anyway you know
 i mean somewhat anyway you know not not as an in depth course of study but i mean
 you know it gets you by anyway you know
 so are you going to work
 uh huh yeah
 that's in the lines along of what i'm after you know
 go on
 sure
 can you imagine doing an externship in that
 that means you would have to go to africa
 yeah that would be pretty neat though its sort of like in the lines of what i'm doing
 um being a sociology major
 i'm very curious not as what a individual does that would be more like social psychology
 i'm talking about ah people as a group
 you know that's sociology
 what makes these people do this or you know or
 you know and that would be kind of along the same lines actually it fulfills part of my major
 african studies
 so it in essence it really does you know fit you know
 but like i said you know they didn't offer it when i wanted it
 so i didn't take it you know
 well
 yeah i'm from new jersey and ah
 the heart of the air pollution i guess i don't know
 we're supposed to be well it doesn't really make a difference what you talk about as long as you
 you know hold a conversation
 that's when i talked when i called up or- originally to find out about it that's what they told me you know
 yeah i sort of go off on a tangent somewhere right
 cars emissions
 stimulating topic huh
 hello
 okay
 i'm amy amy
 amy
 washington
 uh huh
 where are you
 oh
 howard
 howard
 uhhuh
 oh okay
 oh wow that's pretty good in what
 in what
 oh what are you going to do
 uh huh
 oh that's good
 oh that's not bad
 uhhuh
 ah yeah
 uhhuh
 oh oh what a pain
 uh huh
 uh huh well do you but that will not actually be in your field right
 uhhuh
 oh yeah a job
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh okay
 uhhuh
 so are you thinking of going to graduate school or something
 oh yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah i feel pre- um african studies
 uhhuh
 oh really
 hm uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 well um
 for the summer actually its kind of hard to find
 a like a a short term job in this field because it's actually african studies not like african american
 studies more like the continent itself
 so there's not
 uhhuh
 so there's you know there's not s- like even though i'm in washington i mean its probably the best place to be for a job like that but
 still i'll probably have to get some other kind of um
 yeah that would be great
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh uh huh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 well are you from new jersey
 hm
 oh yeah we forgot what do you think is causing
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah it's pretty rare that i actually
 talk about the topic it seems that we always end up talking about uhhuh
 but i personally i think its um besides factories and stuff i think its cars i think
 individual cars
 yeah
 that are doing i mean
 i its so weird to me to see like a bumper sticker that says some-
 so do you think any country is indeed a threat to uh the united states
 oh an internal threat
 and how do you mean that exactly
 uhhuh
 well that's an interesting point that you make because uh it's true i guess that throughout history governments have pointed to foreign threats as a way of uh preventing the
 population from looking at the
 the corruption inside which is the real source of uh danger
 but on the other hand just to be devil's advocate although i do ag- i do agree with you to a large extent and that's an interesting perspective on it uh
 well i i guess i wouldn't say that any one particular nation or country is a threat but uh
 nuclear terrorism i think is uh something that we need to be looking out for in the next
 i think before the end of the century it might happen
 just because um
 you know coming out of the former soviet union there's a lot of these uh
 nuclear scientists and working in these poorly guarded uh installations that were producing weapons grade uranium and they're selling it
 to uh iranians and libyans so
 i mean of course we don't know the details of this but the i know the intelligence agencies track it so
 i guess we have to have the faith that they are sort of intervening and stopping it but
 you never know but as far as a direct threat to sort of the u s i
 i don't know i mean it used to be the soviet union and i think it's hard to say that russia is a threat now
 okay
 so where are you uh i shouldn't say calling from where are you receiving calls from
 oh are you so am i actually calling from a houlihan's restaurant i'm in search of different phones you know
 isn't it yeah
 well how many have you received
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 you know but you should make the effort to make the calls out because you know it is easy money although it is a bit of a chore if you
 yeah
 really
 oh really ha-
 as part of uh what uh part of the university here or
 uhhuh right
 oh
 that's interesting i didn't know they did those experimental things
 sure yeah
 well that's good that's you know
 and uh i don't know i'm uh i'm in graduate school at penn
 the university of penn
 yeah i think that has to do with the fact that uh penn state people have gone home for the most part i guess
 and uh and also that uh they go home earlier than the penn people although penn had its graduation just uh
 w- last week or no i guess this past tuesday
 so uh but well i'm sticking around for the summer i got to work and
 work on my academic writing so
 and hopefully without any threats of from foreign governments or a domestic one
 you know well that's all part of what you were saying i think yeah sort of the other side of saying that these other countries are threats yeah
 and it justifies uh defense spending and
 which which people are trying to do now especially since the cold war is supposedly finished you know they're looking for new excuses and to keep the basis of
 i don't know um i don't
 personally i don't trust um our government you know i ha- yeah
 yeah exactly exactly
 i mean i think um
 i think that they lead us to believe that other countries are a threat because um i think
 our our own government is very corrupt and and money hungry
 you know and um
 exactly exactly
 right right
 okay
 okay
 oh okay
 right
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh uhhuh that's true
 uh philadelphia yeah yeah
 oh th- that's a real trip running around trying to find a different phone to call from
 yeah i really haven't made any calls i've been just receiving them over the last week because i got tired of trying to find places to call from
 i received four and i um called out i called out four times and you're my fourth caller in
 yeah
 yeah that's true that's true but i i participate in a whole bunch of these um study type things so yeah it keeps me really busy i did a a mock uh jury
 um about a week ago and um
 yeah and i made a hundred and fifty dollars just for one day so
 um no um i got it uh through the city paper i looked through the back of the city paper
 and um that was really interesting because what um these big
 companies do as a matter of fact this was um the cigarette industry uh
 they're trying to find out um
 what affects and and whether or not a jury would find them guilty if you know a lot these people took them to court you know
 yeah yeah yeah and uh asbestos um companies they do it too
 yeah so i i do a lot of that kind of stuff
 yeah
 okay um i find that interesting that's where most of uh my callers are from
 yeah yeah i've only had one um that was from penn state
 oh okay okay
 yeah yeah
 okay
 oh i don't i don't think that's going to be a problem you know sometimes i wonder if the government you know and
 ah this may you know just sound paranoid if if they just set up situations so that we can look like the good guys and everybody else looks like the bad guys you know
 yeah yeah
 right right
 uhhuh exa- exactly
 uhhuh
 you disagree with certain things or he may disagree with you and you disagree with him
 okay
 oh yeah
 okay
 oh oka- all right well w- do you guys plan and leave um the state or
 do you all have plans or do your jobs take you out of state or something like that
 okay
 i just think divorce i mean it's it's far more many divorces than it is marriages i mean
 if e- it's a good institution don't get me wrong and we all want to be happy and find that right person
 but from what i've seen all the marriages or e-
 either end up in divorce or they wind up separating after the first year
 because they don't know the person or their mate too well
 uhhuh
 because you know you never know i mean uh it
 many reasons that marriages break up i mean it could be an affair it
 it could be a mistress or something of that nature if you know it could be another man if it's the woman you know
 and e- it never really dawns on the people until they realize it you know
 it never really affects you until you see
 that you really do miss this person
 you know and e- i've never been one to say well marriages if they
 fall apart they shouldn't work because it should work
 you know
 but it's just so darn painful you know and no one deserves to go through that hurt
 i have ah one sister she was married but
 um she got divorced because there was an affair her husband had an affair and it was her girl friend
 and she confronted her and
 it was a lot of things that were said um an altercation took place outside the court
 it was just pretty nasty you know and and i-
 i don't want to go through that i mean i'm i'm seeing someone now
 but i i don't think i will want to get married or anything
 because i wouldn't want to
 take my spouse through that you know i would want to
 be happy but when you get married you you give up a lot and everything becomes as one you know
 well i have a son i i already have a son
 and it's not with her though it's with another lady
 and if you want to have children that's even great but
 children suffer f- from divorce
 they suffers i mean they have to be real strong
 to overcome it because they re thinking because i know i was
 like i said i was a child of of um
 a separation my mother and father separated and
 i was caught in the middle you know in the custody battle you know and that wasn't pretty for me
 you know i had to decide if i wanted to stay with my mom or my dad and
 then once i figured out you know that they didn't do that because of me
 then i was told that they did it because they didn't love each other no more then it was just a lot of stuff you know
 well no because actually when they separated
 i was like about ten because i'm twenty seven now
 and
 it it just hurt you know because they both explained to me
 why that happened or how it happened but i didn't want to believe it all i knew is my mom and dad weren't together no more
 and i realize now that you know that's just life i mean two people they get together they
 they fall in love they get married and then five or six or seven or even eight years down the line
 the problems start happening then they they start arguing and
 the arguing continues and then it's it's it's an ongoing thing i mean
 you have to really love the person to really want to work it out
 no because the marriage was destined to dissolve i i can see that now because
 my father was in vietnam and i don't know if you know anything about that
 he went away when i was very young and
 my mother was alone basically pregnant with me and
 i guess that affected her because he wasn't around and you know at that time
 you know pregnant mothers with husbands in the service you know they
 doing all kinds of things to try and get their husbands back over the states
 over to the states and it was you know
 i don't know if they were to stay together maybe things w-
 oh yeah we have days like that
 but that's kind of one of the things that makes it interesting
 and it's only seven years and
 i don't know how things are going to go in the future
 mm no
 uhhuh
 yeah i just heard some guys in my office today talking
 and um they were talking about how
 a lot of marriages break up about six years or seven years because
 and that's about how long it takes you to really know who it is that you married
 ah do you have any um brothers or sisters who have been divorced
 oh man
 yeah
 yeah
 well what about if you um want to have children
 yeah
 now did you believe that though
 yeah
 yeah
 well what do you think for yourself though
 would it have been better if your parents had stayed together until you were older or
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah hi
 uh i'm jon here
 um do i have to get you my whole name i don't know if you're interested uh what's your name
 heather hi uh so regarding the changes uh i'm uh
 over fifty so um i don't know if you want me to go first or if you want to go first
 okay well um you know i grew up with pretty much uh in the forties and fifties
 and i been um for the most part
 uh appreciative i think of the fact that women have become more uh of their own mind and uh
 sometimes a hassle but most of the time i mean from a man's point of view
 but most of the time it's more challenging and uh interesting and develop more personality on their own
 they don't seem to define themselves as much in terms of uh
 their marriage or relationship
 uh you want me to keep going so go ahead i want to give you a chance to get in
 how do you feel about it
 right
 uhhuh
 right
 who's trying to get you out there
 huh
 that's great
 right i guess you feel a littl- i mean i would think that you might feel a little bit more like a p- pioneer
 you know especially in a field like that i mean it just i don't know of many uh wh- what type of engineering is it
 what is it called
 geo environmental that's even a new one on me so uh
 is it like town planning or something or other
 great
 just trying to keep everything cleaned up huh i mean keep things from becoming toxic at least i hope
 great now that sounds really uh positive um
 so as far as keeping on the subject here um
 and what did they say something about what was the most important uh
 uh changes uh i don't know i guess for for me it's just
 professional i guess most like like uh especially doctors and uh
 politicians lawyers they seem to be having i me- i think feminine feminine side in general has a more humanizing effect
 on society then what man has been doing for the last uh god knows
 how long with the history of wars and uh
 oppression and dogmatism and i grew up in a fairly dogmatic you know um
 patriarchal catholic uh situation
 and even was going to be a priest at one time which is extremely patriarchal
 and managed to get away from all that i think a lot of it had to do with just my mother's influence and uh
 fem- just a feminine uh nurturing uh mentality versus this indoctrinating
 i i feel it's more indoctrinating eh and obedient oriented uh male
 b s you know
 so to me it's more of an overall effect i guess and uh just women in general i mean as long as they can maintain their nurturing uh
 qualities i think it's great that they should be as of independent minded and um
 and able to uh you know influence society as possible you know i think it's great and a matter of fact my favorite place even when i was growing up before i went there uh kind of resounded with it was scandinavia
 they tended to be i always had kind of i mean from the time i was about twenty anyway and got out of the seminary
 i was like kind of hooked on the idea that uh there men and women seemed to be more matter of fact everybody seemed to be more
 equal you know and uh so it's kind of been even though the society seems to be going to hell in a hand basket
 at least it seems that there's uh a more of an equality between uh at least the sexes a little bit not near enough but
 somewhat and that sort of thing so i just didn't want to dominate the conversation here i guess if you have something else to
 hello
 hi
 i'm heath-
 heather
 uhhuh
 oh you can go ahead
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 oh uh well
 um ye- well
 well you know i'm i'm a lot younger i'm only eighteen so i haven't really you know ever since i've really been old enough to know really what's going on it seems like more and more women are you know like
 coming out and uh
 well you know more in the workforce and uh
 and as far as like
 and i know well i'm an engineering major and i know right now
 like the field is really big for women engineers and they're trying to get you know women out into stuff like that the science stuff like that
 well i know it's like
 there's a lot of like societies for women engineers and like
 a lot of like more scholarships like
 for females and stuff like that
 and so they're i they're trying to bring women more into the you know like
 like into the into the work force in professions
 yeah
 um i'm doing geo-environmental
 geo-environmental
 yeah
 yeah that's a new major
 um well actually it deals with a lot of stuff like air or land or water pollution or like on strip mining or
 or oil drilling and um recycling and anything on the lines like that
 yeah
 yeah yeah like designing like systems and like machinery that's more environmentally safe and stuff like that
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 hello
 hi my name is cory

 oh i see that's not well that that's that's a good size for a
 for a a small town high school
 i see and so have you been uh have you been doing this uh this linguistic study thing for long
 uhhuh do you do it every day
 yeah
 do you have do you have another job or is this is this just
 a good source of income for you that's alright yeah it's it
 it's uh it's great actually
 get paid for talking on the phone
 so um what do your parents do
 what kind of engineering does he do
 oh i see
 hm
 um
 were you were you born in seaford like have has your family been there for
 your entire life so
 um
 saskatoon saskatchewan
 saskatchewan do you you were saskatchewan is
 okay oh it's in canada
 um
 it's in the w- it's in the west
 well actually no no i
 no i'm i'm i'm right now i'm at uh
 state college pennsylvania i go to penn state
 um
 but originally i'm from um
 i'm from saskatchewan it's right above
 um montana and the dakotas
 that's where i'm from
 have you ever been uh anywhere in canada
 from from where i'm from
 um
 still a quite a ways away uh maybe
 hm
 maybe a thousand miles
 hello
 hi this is rachma
 uh seaford delaware
 yeah
 uh it's near the coast
 no
 why
 oh was it
 mrs thomas or danielle thomas
 yeah yeah that's probably see my friend
 um who signed me up her sister goes to penn state
 and i think her whole family signed up
 so um that's probably how
 uh i'm a eighth grader
 just i go to school basically
 uh yeah i play tennis
 think i'm start running this year too
 uh not really seriously
 i don't know just sit around
 yeah
 yeah and that's what everyone says
 they're like at least you don't have to go to work
 yeah yeah
 uhhuh
 i well i'm just finishing
 yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uh not too big
 there's about a thousand students in all
 yeah
 uh not really just for about two weeks
 yeah
 i try to
 no this is basically it
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah
 eh my mom is a lab tech and my dad is an engineer
 uh
 no clue he he
 i forgot i
 oh god
 see i knew it was he works at dupont
 so
 he works on my computer and stuff
 i knew this but i just forgot
 yeah
 yeah
 where are you from
 huh
 uh not really
 oh oh yeah okay
 wow i didn't know they did this in canada too
 oh okay
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uh yeah i went to toronto
 actually um how far is vancouver from there
 yeah
 oh really
 here we go um but it seems like it would be a nice place to live
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 ah nope nope
 i've been to state college i was just there um this winter
 but yeah i haven't seen too much of pennsylvania really since we've moved here
 uhhuh
 um actually i thought everyone from here was going to be
 because i saw this at on the on the penn campus
 so i thought it this is s- like a local thing i'm surprised i'm talking to someone
 oh wow
 uhhuh
 um are you in summer school
 uhhuh
 what are you doing
 oh wow
 uhhuh
 oh
 yeah yeah
 so it's like you live there or
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 so i've got the summer off
 yeah yeah but i teach college actually so
 uhhuh
 a philadelphia college of textiles and science
 yeah i just started there
 about a year ago
 um i was in grad school
 yeah yeah i i study history
 so i just got my degree
 yeah i'm working
 um i took ah i took a year off and just like had menial jobs
 and then went to grad school
 um yeah i guess so yeah i was pretty lucky actually
 it's it's been it's really hard for historians these days to
 teaching jobs but um
 yeah i did get one i guess before i got my p h d so
 yeah a lot of my friends are still looking for jobs
 not finding anything
 yeah
 oh you mean like for like elementary school and grade
 really
 uhhuh
 mm
 huh
 right
 good
 what ah do you have an age group you'd like to teach
 ah
 yeah that would be hard um
 i've thought about like teaching high school but ah i don't i think it would be a totally different situation than teach
 uhhuh
 yeah that would be so hard
 uhhuh
 yeah i admire i admire people who are doing that
 maybe you have insights into our suggested topic
 something about something about like teaching arts in the in schools like in grade school
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah i like it a lot
 i mean of course when i was like a teenager i didn't like it but of course
 i love it now it's i i it's looking nice
 it's not like too city like
 i've never been to philly but my roommate's from
 philly and like she's come to pittsburgh and she's like oh this is no comparison
 so have you ever been there
 oh
 oh really
 uhhuh
 yeah
 it's nice i like it
 uhhuh
 yeah the i think university of pennsylvania is like sponsoring it or they're
 you know or they organized it and it's
 it it's all over like rutgers university and i've gotten calls from florida and
 yeah it's all over
 i thought it was just a penn state thing you know i didn't know
 yeah there's like i've talked to people from like all over the country
 yeah
 well i'm not taking classes this summer i have a job
 yeah
 i'm just well i am taking care of three little kids i'm like
 a nanny i guess
 yeah it's nice
 i like it i don't feel like clean up the house and everything which sucks but
 like it's i'm an elementary education major so it's like kind of good practice
 hm yeah
 no i live in my apartment and i just go there every morning
 yeah it's pretty nice
 oh you do
 you do
 what do you teach
 oh
 wow
 uhhuh
 that's cool what did you do before that
 oh were you okay
 hm
 yeah
 so you
 wha- did you find it difficult like right out of did you
 go straight through like after you graduated did you g- go straight into graduate school or did you like
 teach for a couple of years or whatever
 yeah
 wow
 and you got a job like right out of grad school
 yeah
 uhhuh
 that's good
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah i've known friends of mine to have been substitute teaching for like seven years an-
 still not have a permanent job
 uhhuh
 well yeah well more secondary then e-
 elementary school i think it's easier to get
 hired in elementary school because a lot more positions open
 wait for secondary you have to you know declare your
 you know area of expertise and everything so
 and it gets a lot c- more closed than it would be for elementary education
 which is my plan so
 yeah
 um well i
 more i feel more comfortable with the younger age
 kids probably like third grade and under because you know once they start getting up
 you know they're getting older they start getting more brattier so
 around fourth grade is when they start to rebel so
 i like to stay away from that age
 yeah
 i think it usually depends i that's just my opinion i think it depends on what
 like what type of student you're teaching like you know how if they have a tracking system like
 the higher ability kids they're a lot more you know cooperative and they're there to learn they do the work but
 no i've known teachers who've
 gotten stuff you know they teach the lowest track and those kids you know
 they're just like baby sitting them because they don't want to learn and they just
 disrupt the class you you don't get anything accomplished
 yeah
 so it's like that a lot with the junior high age kids too
 you know that e- any teacher i know that works on that level like
 a lot of them that i know they can't stand it and they like
 apply for transfers and can't wait to you know
 get out of there and teach high school or something
 so yeah
 yeah i do too
 it's tough
 oh god
 i don't even remember what the topic is now anymore
 oh oh yeah yeah
 oh god um well yeah i think it's a lot more important than
 people recognize
 because you know everyone you know the first things to get budget cuts are you know the arts and
 theater and stuff like that and they don't realize its importance and
 contribution you know the kids need ex- need expose to a lot of things more than just
 you know your reading english science basic
 subjects they don't realize the importance of all the other subjects out
 so this is the first topic that i've really been interested in
 s- um actually you know a few movies on h b o i just saw nell
 and uh
 ir- iron eagle was on
 eh the cheesiest action movies of all time
 what are some movies you've seen recently
 no i don't recall that title even
 oh i i think that was that like a couple years old
 okay
 that's recent i haven't seen it no
 i see where where are you
 well that's where i am from
 yeah
 actually right now i'm not i'm in utah right now
 but there in state college you got mike's i mean any movie you want is forty nine cents basically
 if you have a v c r
 i didn't see that either that was mel gibson right
 and animal house is on the t v in front of me right now
 a classic comedy
 do you enjoy movies at all
 uhhuh
 oh really
 what's is it for his business or
 huh
 hey i like hitchcock movies
 they're
 top notch work all around
 no i don't know that one
 basically if it's not a real big title i probably haven't seen it
 oh yeah
 north by northwest
 to catch a thief there's one of my favorite movies
 yeah that's a good movie james stewart and grace kelly also
 grace kelly is in to catch a thief too
 but it's cary grant
 cary grant is one of my favorite actors so
 that makes that easy
 i don't know don't know what that might refer to
 oh yeah i guess
 if i try and oh hombre that was a good movie i saw maybe a month ago it's an old paul newman movie
 it'd be worth seeing probably if you if you enjoy paul newman at all
 oh el mariachi yeah that's a great movie i was oh i was amazed by that
 hi
 what movies have you seen lately
 oh
 i'm trying to remember um
 oh what happened
 things that stick in my mind did you see what was it heavenly creatures
 it was the one about the uh two teenage girls in australia who
 kill the one's mother
 anyway that was we took our teenaged son and i've
 wondered if that was really a smart thing to do
 i mean not not that i minded him seeing hints of lesbianism so much as i think it would make a kid feel really guilty to watch
 yeah it is
 um what have i seen lately
 was what was it was c- it casino
 did you see that
 okay
 uh we live in a small town we don't get much in the way of good movies here
 state college pennsylvania
 oh really
 so we could be are you in state college right now
 oh okay i wondered the connection isn't wonderful
 yeah yeah well my son watched braveheart last night
 yeah that's gets probably a bunch of sentimental nonsense
 ooh
 yeah i do but i
 it's funny my husband is in l a right now reading scripts of
 um
 alfred hitchcock
 yeah
 ah he's a professor at the university
 and he started at writing a book on nineteen forty seven and got so intrigued with the movies that i think the book will probably be all about movies
 so he's been watching a lot of old forties and fifties stuff
 yeah they're very fine
 um
 did you ever see i confess
 that goes back to i think that's a forty seven movie
 the birds
 okay
 okay i don't think i remember that one um
 what was rear window
 yeah
 uhhuh
 trying trying to think of things i've seen more recently
 um i the one on um oh
 the life of the uh woman writer whose part of the algonquin circle
 what was her name it's just called mrs something i've
 that was what i found just kind of empty
 well i mean she's got lots of witty remarks in it but there's no plot she just she falls in love with people and they reject her and she gets drunker and drunker then i guess she dies
 and i thought why di- this was not meant for a movie you know
 might have been a good something else but not a movie reminded me that movies have to be pictures
 what else have you seen lately
 oh don't know that one
 did you see the what was it the uh not the guitar player um
 yeah the one about the spanish guitarist
 yeah
 we had people that was in the program at columbia
 doing their time when i was there cause i'm actually i'm a theater person
 so
 i'm a theater person
 i meant yeah
 well i i work for a theater in philadelphia a i'm a literary manager
 that's what i do
 you have
 what aspect
 okay
 that's true so do you know most of the local actors here
 oh okay
 okay
 okay
 and make some money also yes yes yes
 yeah i tell me about it i know i know oh
 well you should i mean now since you one of the things especially once you go back and get the security is you can always do it
 and one and one that i don't know if you know about philadelphia but the actors in philadelphia who work they work a lot
 yeah
 philadelphia is probably
 unlike most especially most major metropolitan areas where you have people trying to you know make a living as a actor
 in philadelphia you can really you can you can make a decent living i mean you most people most of the good actors
 leave one show and move right to another show
 so that's one of the good things so if you ever decide to go and do it and plus also if you have the shakespearian background
 you without a doubt you should definitely be able to get work in the philadelphia area
 and there some there are some you know i mean
 g- i mean its all relative but there is some relatively good the- theater here you know
 ah the arden is one place the wilma is another place
 there's the philadelphia theater company and
 and the company that i work for is philadelphia festival theater for new plays so
 well that's i'm in i'm located in the annenberg
 yeah we're located in the annenberg we're supposed to be the resident resident theater
 uh at the annenberg center
 we have an autonomous status but you know we work and so we
 do all of our stuff at the annenberg
 no no i you know literary manager is basically responsible for the script that's coming in and you know then deciding
 what you want to do readings on and what you want to try to do for the next season
 that's basically what i've been doing research is
 mostly done by dramaturgies but then some literary managers also do research but we have a small staff so i don't
 eh we just don't have the capacity to do research you know we
 we i read the plays and then
 um you know pass them on to other people and if we decide decide that we want to do a reading of of the play then we do a reading of the play
 and after that if we decide if w- um if we want to try to produce it
 and that's basically how it works i think across the country
 with people who are working as literary managers
 so that's that's it
 yeah that's just the kind of stuff i i i really i really would advise you to go back
 s- plus i mean i don't know if you have that much time but just
 at least try to go to some reading
 and that kind of stuff and see what's what's happening in the area
 you know
 yeah you with it
 what what what have you seen
 oh right right in at at the annenberg
 right
 i didn't see that i heard it was j- j- reduced shakespeare and some people said it wasn't that good i didn't get a chance to see that
 right
 hm
 uhhuh
 oh okay i don't even think i was in town then i think i was out of the cou- a
 yeah i was out
 yeah
 hm
 okay do you have a do you have a head shot in all of that you don't okay
 oh okay
 don't even mention student don't mention the student loan
 we're all we're all paying off the student loan
 no cause i was going to say if you had some head shots you should mail it around you know
 mail one in to us and that kind of s-
 well i don't know i don't know any a see i'm from new york so i don't really know
 i know the new york scene much better than i do the philadelphia scene i'm only here because my wife is in school
 and i sort of walked in and you know talked with them and they asked me to do this job ah
 so i mean you could always find out you know if you want go to a professional photographer but you have to sort of find it
 yeah
 yeah
 uh huh
 your a um say again
 oh really what what do you do
 oh okay
 okay i was i've been a theater person myself before but a
 yeah i was
 i was an actor
 um and you know
 once an actor always an actor if if somebody asked me i'd say of course i'm still an actor
 i don't
 no i've had very little i've had no contact since i came to philadelphia i was
 i moved from portland oregon
 where i was in a shakespeare company
 for a couple of seasons um
 but it got to be the the point where i really had to make some choices in my life about my career
 and make some money exactly exactly it sure it was not putting food on the table
 right
 really
 uh huh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 wow great
 right
 that's that's
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh okay i've
 i've only been to the annenberg
 are you okay
 uhhuh
 huh okay
 so as a literary manager do you do research about the play that your putting on or are are y-
 i see
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 huh wow
 right yeah yeah
 yeah oh it i have been sorely tempted many times
 you know every time i go and see a play i think i should be doing this again
 oh i saw the a the five person um romeo and juliet that came it was a touring company
 right at the annenberg it it was very good
 i thought
 it was it was good in that um i was just impressed at the um at the the the
 their ability to change roles so quickly
 and they take on different characters not everybody was as strong as each other they were
 definitely a few people who stood out
 um and what else have i seen actually i haven't seen a whole lot of theater theater i've seen a couple of performance
 art artists
 there was a a troupe who came through maybe a a little over a year ago
 who made music with um a blowing on things like household instruments this was a a f-
 a f- this was a yeah it was a family group this
 father and his three daughters
 they did some fantastic incredible things and then i saw stomp when they came through
 no i don't no i its been a while like said i came out to go to school and i didn't do anything but go to school
 so now i'm i'm a paying off my student loans and
 right that's about it
 yeah
 yeah
 okay well where where do i go to get a head shot these days i mean you know what's a good a you have suggestions for that
 okay uh huh
 i see
 uhhuh uhhuh
 yeah
 um h- has the system been being weird
 okay it has for me too and i ju- i'm kind of like
 received uhhuh
 or ah period
 made or received
 really
 oh
 uhhuh that's happened to me a lot
 but i've made a lot of successful calls
 so and i've received yeah maybe three or four
 but um
 but i mean i've done it for a long time now its old habit
 oh really
 well oh okay well i didn't know that either i i don't know what the end date is i i
 had heard it was sometime around mid june
 but e-
 it's trailing off of something maybe
 in philadelphia i'm um
 north um of center city up ah second and gerard i don't know if you
 are you in west philly
 oh
 oh okay
 uhhuh what's your field
 oh really
 and are you a feminist
 yeah
 uhhuh
 oh because it's the reigning ideology in
 all of academia essentially and certainly in english departments
 of all things yeah i'm an anti-feminist
 yeah i'm i'm not anti-woman but i'm anti-feminist
 well i think feminism is a very damaging ideology
 in general because it's it's anti-scholarship first of all
 um
 well i don't i think it is by essence anti-scholarly i i think it goes against
 the scholastic um philosophies of you know from eleven fifty which
 basically carried through until modernism
 um and feminism kind of picked up where modernism left off
 and um this is my opinion obviously but ah
 what specifically what
 um it doesn't believe that objectivity is possible in any way
 it does not seek objectivity
 um because it it bel- it doesn't believe in it
 uh it it really ultimately um undermines the whole idea of scholarship
 uhhuh
 well you would certainly yeah i mean there are hard sciences so to speak and
 um
 right
 right although
 um feminist doesn't usually take responsibility for it's own positions and
 and
 uhhuh
 oh yeah
 certainly something
 oh yeah terribly weird
 this this is actually only the second call i've successfully had
 happen
 yeah yeah
 period
 period yeah its it's amazing
 yeah i've had
 yeah what happens to me most of the time is that
 that the system calls up
 and it sort of gets halfway into the introduction just sort of dies
 yeah i've had a lot of that
 uhhuh
 uhhuh oh well that's oh well that's good
 yeah you know i one of the guys who runs this um
 project um i know because we both take our kids to the
 same bus stop in the morning for school
 yeah and um i thought that the that the whole project was
 basically over i thought that they had gathered all of the
 material they needed
 ah yeah i th- i guess i don't know maybe they um
 yeah something like that so where are you
 oh yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah sure
 yeah
 yeah yeah we're ah
 i i teach at penn
 and ah we live about
 thirteen or fourteen blocks from campus
 classical studies and comparative literature
 yeah
 am i one
 ah i guess i don't necessarily self identify as one though i usually find myself in
 basic sympathy with people who do
 why do you ask that
 e- you are
 ex- like e-
 and in in what sense d- are you
 uhhuh
 oh well i mean i've seen plenty of instances of that it certainly is
 true that it can be carried out in an anti-scholarly way
 uhhuh
 well well that's interesting i mean why why
 specifically i because i don't i don't quite understand
 ah why specifically is it anti-scholarly
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah i see what you mean well in some fields um
 it seems to me that objectivity is a lot harder to arrive at than in others and you know
 right
 and you know it seems to me that that feminist critique of
 a good deal of what goes on in the humanities is
 you know not misplaced in that a lot of what's being discussed
 is ultimately is a matter of of opinion i mean
 it would be one thing to argue that you know the declaration of independence
 wasn't in fact written in seventeen seventy six or whatever
 um but it would be a different thing to argue that
 the you know prospective of the declaration of independence on
 human liberty was not necessarily
 ah as complete as it might be because of
 didn't really take into account the position of women
 i mean
 it that's often true i mean i i was once in a
 in a rather interesting seminar that
 ah was mainly populated by people in the english department at penn
 and um a point about um
 you know inheritance law governing rights of succession to the english throne was raised
 and somebody challenged the point this was by a feminist scholar and somebody challenged the point
 and her respon- her response was
 well it's true that i could argue it that way but my agenda is in fact to argue it in the following way and it
 it
 you know it was it was sort of
 astonishing
 to to hear somebody say this
 but she said it without batting an eye
 and i i sort of listened to this and i thought wow that's really
 you know pretty pretty bold faced
 yeah i mean it was it was really kind of incred-
 well now where do you learn about current events
 yeah
 um
 what station do you watch where are you
 wow how did you get involved in this program
 uhhuh uhhuh
 somebody you knew in pennsylvania
 uhhuh
 okay
 so you get your new your your news from t v uh what
 what programs do you watch
 uhhuh
 uhhuh what i mean what news shows
 uhhuh
 i think i know what that is that's n b c isn't it
 yeah
 uhhuh
 well i usually i usually watch the n b c station and it has
 um
 it has
 the today show in the morning
 and it has the evening news and i can watch them while i'm fixing
 breakfast in the morning and supper at night
 um
 i often watch sixty minutes which of course is on c b s
 all of the the
 channels in in philadelphia that that carry the network news also have a local news
 show that has the weather and that's that's as important to me as anything else that i
 i get from t v
 um i don't feel
 and i do sometimes watch public radio news and i watch the mcneil lehrer um
 discussion program
 washington week in review on friday nights usually have you ever seen that
 yeah there is a yeah that's the thing that g- happens
 there is one of them and i'm not sure which one it is does a show
 between six and seven on our local in the evenings
 on our local public t v station and it's
 um
 it's pretty good it gives a very brief
 summary of the the day's headlines only once
 you know if you miss that you've had it and it also doesn't have the local news or the local weather which is why i don't watch it regularly
 what it does have that's good is is
 usually two two or three topics are treated in depth
 i frankly i don't think t v news is adequate at all
 for understanding an issue i mean if i really want to know about it
 uh
 i go g- i go get the paper
 um
 i read a few specialized
 things that come in the mail you know i'm in touch with organizations that work on
 issues i'm concerned about
 because the uh the t v coverage is just so very superficial
 oh yeah
 hm
 uhhuh
 uhhuh and a lot of it's taken up with commercials
 that seems to me that they're taking up a larger proportion of the time than they than they did maybe five or ten years ago i don't know
 uhhuh uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah
 yeah maybe so
 well
 let's see what else is there what are wh-
 do you get news from any other source
 uhhuh what do you read out there
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 t v
 uh i'm in michigan
 uh somebody e-mailed me
 and they
 um i'm o- i was on a mailing list and ah
 somebody said like yeah does anybody want to make extra money
 so i just answered it and
 yeah
 um i- eh actually i don't watch too much
 i don't watch too many t v programs i just usually try and catch news
 um most times i just watch like the sunday movies or
 oh news shows
 actually news sho- i watch like stuff like dateline sometimes
 um
 yeah and that's that's a main station that i watch most of the time
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 um no i've seen the ah
 the mcneil lehrer report
 oh yeah
 yeah
 oh yeah
 well it seems to be more sensationalized than anything else
 it's not like it seems to be like all about ratings you know
 it seems to be all about ratings
 so figured they won't exactly cover everything that's going to
 they they won't exactly cover everything that's important they'll cover the things that'll get people's attention first and then you know they only have so much time and
 yeah
 yeah
 well it seems that the se- well i guess it's probably because
 television shows are more costly to produce now
 and they had to sell more time
 um probably the newspaper
 uh detroit news
 but actually i'm not supposed to read the detroit news because they're on strike
 but it's been a it's been a year now
 you can't go a whole year without reading the newspaper

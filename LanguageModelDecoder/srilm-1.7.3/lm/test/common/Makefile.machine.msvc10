# Makefile to augment Makefile.machine.msvc for Visual Studio 2010.
# Please first set up your environment for Visual Studio 2010 by running
# the Microsoft .bat setup file:
# "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"
#
# NOTE: The command above may fail if the regedit reg.exe program is not
# in your path as may be the default case on Windows 7. Typically, ensure
# C:\windows\system32 is in your path.
#
# This Makefile is essentially equivalent to running:
#  make MACHINE_TYPE=msvc MSVCDir=$VCINSTALLDIR
# or
#  make MACHINE_TYPE=msvc MSVCDir="c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\Tools\\vsvars32.bat"
# *EXCEPT* will create binaries in "msvc10*" directories instead of "msvc*".
#
# Among others, the following two environment variables should be set:
#  VCINSTALLDIR
#  WindowsSdkDir (used to locate mt.exe)

# Use this default location unless overridden on command line
MSVCDir ?= C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC

# The casing we expect to find for Visual Studio 10 is
# WindowsSdkDir. But, if not set, will fall back on older
# all caps WINDOWSSDKDIR if set, or common default.
ifeq ($(WindowsSdkDir), )
  ifeq ($(WINDOWSSDKDIR), )
    WindowsSdkDir = C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0A\\
  else
    WindowsSdkDir = $(WINDOWSSDKDIR)
  endif
endif

# Note that Makefile.machine.msvc internally uses
# WINDOWSSDKDIR but will take the value from WindowsSdkDir if set.
